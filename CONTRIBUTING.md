We welcome and appreciate input and updates from credible trusted sources such as government agencies, healthcare organizations and media.
- *Increase personalization.* This can be done by extending the rules of the bot, adding new classes of content, adding new questions, updating existing questions etc.

- Create a pull request describing your changes
- Add a [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) compliant PR title (e.g. `fix(content): typo in travel-restrictions`) summarizing your changes
