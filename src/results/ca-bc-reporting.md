## Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you have traveled to an affected area or develop symptoms, avoid contact with others and call ahead to a health-care professional. Do the same if you develop symptoms and have been in contact with a confirmed case or a traveller returning from the affected area with these symptoms.

Tell your health-care professional:

- your symptoms;
- where you have been travelling or living;
- if you had direct contact with animals (for example, if you visited a live animal market); and
- if you had close contact with a sick person, especially if they had a fever, cough or difficulty breathing.

Call ahead to the health-care facility you are planning to visit so they can be prepared to take precautions. In an emergency, describe your symptoms, travel history and any sick contacts when you first arrive at the facility so that appropriate precautions can be taken.

Until more is understood about the virus, older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are considered at higher risk of severe disease.
