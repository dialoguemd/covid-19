# Self-isolation

Early epidemiologic evidence suggests that the majority of people who develop COVID-19 will have mild illness and may not require care in a hospital. It is important that people who do not require hospital-level care convalesce at home as long as effective self-isolation and appropriate monitoring (i.e. for worsening of illness) can be provided.

Cases/PUIs should be isolated in the home setting while symptomatic (i.e. not go out unless directed to do so to seek medical care) until symptoms have resolved and the person is feeling well enough to resume normal activities, and has met the clinical and laboratory criteria set by the PHA for discontinuing isolation

The case/PUI should isolate themselves in the home setting until advised by the Public Health Authority (PHA) that isolation can be discontinued. Staying at home means:

- Not go out unless directed to do so (i.e. to seek medical care)
- Not go to school, work, or other public areas
- Not use public transportation (e.g. buses, subways, taxis)
