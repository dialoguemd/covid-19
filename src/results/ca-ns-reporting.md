## Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Travellers coming to Canada from [one of the affected areas](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/covid-19-affected-areas-list.html) continue to be at an increased risk for infection. Anyone who has travelled from an affected area should closely monitor their health for 14 days after their arrival in Canada.

If you have travelled to an affected area and develop a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, call 811 to arrange an assessment.
