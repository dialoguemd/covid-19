## Northern Territories: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you are experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath contact your health care provider. Describe your symptoms over the phone before your appointment so the clinic can arrange to see you without exposing others. Let them know if you have travelled in the last 14 days or been exposed to someone that has travelled during that time.

### If your symptoms become severe call 9-1-1.
