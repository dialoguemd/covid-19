## Northern Territories: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you have been travelling and you are sick you should tell your health care provider. You should also tell your health care provider if you become ill after contact with someone who has travelled (particularly if that person has been ill). If you seek health care, wear a mask or ask for one when you get there.

Let your healthcare provider know:

- Your symptoms and when they started;
- Where you have been travelling or living;
- If you became sick while travelling or have become sick since returning home;
- If you have been in close contact with someone who is sick and was travelling; and
- If you have been in direct contact with animals or fluids (ie. droppings, blood).
