## Nova Scotia: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Anyone who has travelled outside Canada may have come in contact with the novel coronavirus and should closely monitor their health for 14 days after returning to the country.

Travellers who start to feel unwell, should stay at home/self-isolate away from the public. Individuals who develop fever, with a temperature 38Â°C or higher, and/or cough should call 811 for assessment.

People in Nova Scotia who have been directed to self-isolate can receive supporting health information from Nova Scotia Health Authority Public Health by [contacting the nearest office](http://www.nshealth.ca/public-health-offices).
