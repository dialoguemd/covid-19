## Quebec: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Quebec residents who develop fever or cough symptoms or respiratory difficulties when they return from a trip outside of Canada are invited to contact Info-Santé 811. As needed, the caseworker will tell them what institution to visit for a check-up. If a consultation is required, it is important for residents to inform the health care facility about their travel history before they go to the facility or when they arrive so that the necessary preventive measures can be taken.

As of March 10, 2020, for COVID-19, all countries outside of Canada are now on the enhanced monitoring list [as per the Ministry of Health and Social Services](https://www.msss.gouv.qc.ca/professionnels/documents/liste-des-pays-mrsi.pdf).
