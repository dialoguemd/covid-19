## Alberta: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you have symptoms and recently travelled outside Canada or were exposed to someone who has COVID-19, stay home and call [Health Link 811](https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html) for instructions. Do not go to the ER.

If you need immediate medical attention, call 911 and inform them that you may have COVID-19.
