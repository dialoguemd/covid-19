## üë¥üèª People at higher risk for COVID-19 complications

The Government of Canada [states](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html) that older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are at a higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19.

While most people with COVID-19 will be able to recover at home, people who are at higher risk who develop symptoms of COVID-19 should seek medical advice sooner than people who are younger and/or otherwise healthy.

**Please keep monitoring official guidance for higher risk individuals.**
