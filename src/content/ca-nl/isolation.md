## Self-isolation

Anyone who has been in Hubei province, China or Iran in the 14 days prior to their return to Canada is being asked to self-isolate (away from work and school) and monitor themselves and their children closely. The self-isolation period is 14 days from their last day in Hubei province of China or Iran. Those in self-isolation should contact 811 to receive supporting health information from Newfoundland and Labrador Public Health.
