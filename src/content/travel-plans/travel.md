## 🛫 Safety and security abroad

Canadians should avoid non-essential travel to China, Iran and northern Italy.

All travellers should be aware that there are health risks when you travel. It is important to check your destination before you leave to know the risks and to be prepared. You can reduce your risk by taking precautions when travelling to areas where there is risk of coronaviruses. Please consult the destination page on [travel.gc.ca](http://travel.gc.ca/) for the latest travel advice.

While you are away, and when you return, it is important to monitor your health. If you become sick while travelling, call ahead to a health professional to explain your symptoms. If you become sick upon your return, call your local Public Health Authority for further instructions.

Travellers should expect increased health screening measures at points of entry for international destinations, including airports. Local authorities may impose control measures suddenly, including movement restrictions such as quarantines.

Some governments have implemented special entry and exit restrictions for their territory. Before travelling, verify with the foreign diplomatic mission of your destination to see if its authorities have implemented any specific restrictions related to this situation. These include entry requirements, border closures and flight suspensions.
