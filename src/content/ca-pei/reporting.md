## Prince Edward Island: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

### What should I do if I have travelled within the last 14 days from areas affected by COVID-19(link is external) (other than Hubei province in China or Iran)?

At this time, all travellers who have returned from affected areas(link is external) (other than Hubei province or Iran) are being asked to monitor themselves and their children closely for 14 days after returning home, and to call 811 if they develop any symptoms (fever, cough, or difficulty breathing).

### What should I do if I have travelled within the last 14 days from Hubei province in China or Iran?

The provinces and territories are recommending that arriving travellers who have been in Hubei province (including Wuhan) or Iran voluntarily self-isolate for 14 days after arriving home. Self-isolation means these travellers should stay at home and not attend school or work. Returning travellers from Hubei are encouraged to call 811 to connect with local Public Health for further advice and support. Public Health is available to support people who have been travelling to ensure they know the symptoms to monitor themselves.

### What should I do if I have not been travelling recently but I am still concerned about COVID-19?

If you have not been travelling recently but are still concerned about coronavirus, please read the following questions carefully:

1. In the past 14 days, have you been in close contact with a confirmed case of novel coronavirus?
2. In the past 14 days, have you been in close contact with a person with fever or acute respiratory illness (new or worsening cough or difficulty breathing) who has been travelling to an affected area(link is external) within 14 days prior to becoming ill?

- If the answer is YES to either question, stay at home and call 811 for further assessment.
- If the answer is NO to all questions, no special measures are needed. It is also that time of year when respiratory viruses that cause the common cold or other illness, like the flu, are circulating in our communities.
