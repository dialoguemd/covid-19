## Self-isolation

Self-isolation means avoiding situations where you could infect other people. This can help prevent the spread of infections. DO NOT attend activities or gatherings where you may come in close contact with other people. This includes work, school and university, public transport (plane/bus/taxi/carpool), health-care facilities, faith-based facilities (church), grocery stores or restaurants, shopping malls, sporting events, concerts and birthday parties. 

You should limit contact with people other than family members or individuals you travelled with. If you are in a home where other people have not been exposed, minimize close contact with the other
members of your household by avoiding situations where you may have close contact. Ask friends to drop off groceries and supplies, or use a delivery or pick-up service.

Check with Health Links–Info Santé if you have any questions about self-isolation. Also, if you have a service provider that regularly comes into your home to provide necessary care or assistance to yourself or a family member (e.g. home care), they should be notified.
