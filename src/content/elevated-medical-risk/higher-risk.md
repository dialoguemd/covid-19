## üë¥üèª People at higher risk for COVID-19 complications

The Governmement of Canada [states](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html) that older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are at a higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19.

### What to do if you are at higher risk:

- Stay at home as much as possible.
- Make sure you have access to several weeks of medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged periods of time.
- When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact and wash your hands often.
- Avoid crowds.

If you are at increased risk for COVID-19 complications, please consult with your healthcare provider for more information about monitoring your health for symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. While most people with COVID-19 will be able to recover at home, people who are at higher risk who develop symptoms of COVID-19 should seek medical advice sooner than people who are younger and/or otherwise healthy.
