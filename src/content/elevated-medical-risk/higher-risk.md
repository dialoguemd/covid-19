## üë¥üèª People at higher risk for COVID-19 complications

Current information suggests that older people and people with severe chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, are at higher risk of developing more serious illness from COVID-19.

### What to do if you are at higher risk:

- Stay at home as much as possible.
- Make sure you have access to several weeks of medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged periods of time.
- When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact and wash your hands often.
- Avoid crowds.

If you are at increased risk for COVID-19 complications, please consult with your healthcare provider for more information about monitoring your health for symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. While most people with COVID-19 will be able to recover at home, people who are at higher risk who develop symptoms of COVID-19 should seek medical advice sooner than people who are younger and/or otherwise healthy.
