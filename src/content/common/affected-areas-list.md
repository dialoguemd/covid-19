## üåç Affected Areas

The number of countries now reporting cases of COVID-19 has expanded and continues to change on a daily basis. The World Health Organization (WHO) is maintaining lists of affected areas/countries in their daily [Situation Report](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports), which can be found on the WHO website.

There are two lists in the Situation Reports; one for China (Table 1. Confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 acute respiratory disease reported by provinces, regions and cities in China) and one for all other countries (Table 2. Countries, territories or areas outside China with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths).

Health professionals in Canada who are involved in the assessment and management of possible COVID-19 cases and their close contacts are encouraged to consult these tables in the daily WHO Situation Report to help inform their decision making. The decision to proceed with laboratory testing should be based on direction provided by the provincial/territorial public health authority.

As of March 12, 2020, more than 118 countries are affected and the WHO consider the risk assessment on a global level to be very high.
