## Saskatchewan: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Like most respiratory illnesses, most people with common coronavirus illness will recover on their own. There is no specific treatment for disease caused by a novel coronavirus. However, many of the symptoms can and should be treated. If symptoms feel worse than a standard cold, see a health care provider or call Healthline at 811.

If you are planning to see your health care provider or go to the emergency room, please call ahead and explain your symptoms and travel history so they can make appropriate safety accommodations.
