## Nova Scotia: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you’ve travelled outside Canada, you may have come in contact with the novel coronavirus. You should closely monitor your health for 14 days after you get back to Canada.

If you’ve travelled recently and you start to feel unwell, you should self isolate. This means you should stay home, away from the public.

If you develop a fever, with a temperature 38°C or higher, or a cough, you should call 811 for assessment.

Nova Scotia Health Authority has established COVID-19 [assessment centres](http://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus). If you need in-person assessment, 811 will refer you to a centre. Don't go to a COVID-19 assessment centre unless 811 referred you.

If you’ve been directed to self-isolate, you can get information from Nova Scotia Health Authority Public Health by [contacting the nearest office](http://www.nshealth.ca/public-health-offices).
