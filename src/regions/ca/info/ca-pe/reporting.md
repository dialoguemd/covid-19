## Prince Edward Island: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

8-1-1 is experiencing higher than normal call volumes. It will take longer than usual to respond to your call. We are working hard to respond to all calls as quickly as possible. Thank you for your patience.

If you develop COVID-19 symptoms, including new onset fever, new or worsening cough, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, congestion or unusual fatigue. You should call your family physician or nurse practitioner. If you do not have a family physician or nurse practitioner or are unable to reach them, call 8-1-1.

Anyone who has travelled outside of Prince Edward Island must self-isolate for 14 days. Stop all non-essential travel outside of Prince Edward Island.
