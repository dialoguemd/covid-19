## Prince Edward Island: Online self-assessment tool

This [self-assessment tool](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/service/self-assessment-covid-19) is for anyone experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, returning from travel and those who have come in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 to help determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19. You can complete this assessment for yourself or on behalf of someone else, if they are not able.

Testing is currently focused on individuals who have returned from travel, including from within Canada and the US, or had contact with someone diagnosed as having COVID-19, or have developed symptoms of COVID-19, including a fever, new or worsening cough, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, congestion or unusual fatigue, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chills, headache, muscle aches and acute loss of sense of smell or taste.
