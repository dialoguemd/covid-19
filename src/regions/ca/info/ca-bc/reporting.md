## British Columbia: What should I do if I think I have COVID-19?

Use the [self-assessment tool](https://bc.thrive.health/) to see if you need testing.

If you have symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat or sneezing, avoid contact with others and self-isolate at home for at least 10 days. While at home, take care of yourself by drinking lots of water and getting plenty of rest. After 10 days, if your temperature is normal and you feel better, you can return to your routine activities. Coughing may persist for several weeks, so a cough alone does not mean you need to continue to self-isolate for more than 10 days.

If your symptoms worsen, for example you have mild shortness of breath, contact your health care provider or HealthLinkBC (8-1-1) at any time. If you are going to visit your health care provider, call them ahead of time so they can arrange for you to be assessed safely. Wear a mask in order to protect others.

If your symptoms are severe, such as difficulty breathing (e.g. struggling to breathe or speaking in single words) or chest pain, call 9-1-1 or go to your nearest Emergency Department.

### I am a returning traveller, should I self-isolate or stay home from public spaces?

Anyone arriving in British Columbia from outside of Canada will be asked to self-isolate and monitor for symptoms for 14 days upon their arrival. Returning travellers that develop respiratory symptoms are also required to self-isolate for a period 10 days after the onset of symptoms, whenever they occur. 

- Example 1: Respiratory symptoms appear five days after returning to Canada. Self-isolate for 10 additional days for a total of 15 days. 

-Example 2: Respiratory symptoms appear two days after returning to Canada. Self-isolate for 10 additional days for a total of 12 days.

People who have self-isolated can return to normal activities after 14 days if they have not developed any symptoms.
