## British Columbia: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other respiratory illnesses, including the flu and common cold. They include cough, sneezing, fever, sore throat and difficulty breathing.

Contact your healthcare provider if you have developed symptoms and have been in close contact with someone known to have COVID-19. Do the same if you develop symptoms and have been in contact with a traveller returning from an affected area with widespread community spread of COVID-19.

Tell your health-care professional:

- your symptoms;
- where you have been travelling or living;
- if you had direct contact with animals (for example, if you visited a live animal market); and
- if you had close contact with a sick person, especially if they had a fever, cough or difficulty breathing.

Call ahead to the health-care facility you are planning to visit so they can be prepared to take precautions. In an emergency, describe your symptoms, travel history and any sick contacts when you first arrive at the facility so that appropriate precautions can be taken.

Until more is understood about the virus, older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are considered at higher risk of severe disease.
