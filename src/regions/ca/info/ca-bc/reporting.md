## British Columbia: What should I do if I think I have COVID-19?

Use the [BC COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool](https://bc.thrive.health/) to help determine if you need further assessment or testing for COVID-19. You can complete this assessment for yourself, or on behalf of someone else, if they are unable to.

If you have [COVID-19 compatible symptoms](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/about-covid-19/symptoms) avoid contact with others and self-isolate at home for at least 10 days. Go to the [If you are sick](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/about-covid-19/if-you-are-sick) page for details on how to stop the spread of germs, what to do if your symptoms get worse and ending self-isolation.

### I am a returning traveller, should I self-isolate?

Yes, you should self-isolate. Please visit our [self-isolation](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation) page to learn how long to self-isolate if you are a returning traveller.
