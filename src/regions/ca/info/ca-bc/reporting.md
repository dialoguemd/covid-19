## British Columbia: What should I do if I think I have COVID-19?

Use the [BC COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool](https://bc.thrive.health/) to help determine if you need further assessment or testing for COVID-19. You can complete this assessment for yourself, or on behalf of someone else, if they are unable to.

If you have [COVID-19 compatible symptoms](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/about-covid-19/symptoms) avoid contact with others and self-isolate at home for at least 10 days. Go to the [If you are sick](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/about-covid-19/if-you-are-sick) page for details on how to stop the spread of germs, what to do if your symptoms get worse and ending self-isolation.

### I am a returning traveller, should I self-isolate?

Yes, you should self-isolate. Learn about self-isolation and self-monitoring, what to do if you get sick, and how to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on the [BCCDC website](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation). As of March 25, 2020, all persons arriving in Canada must self-isolate (quarantine) and monitor for symptoms for 14 days under the [Quarantine Act](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2020/03/new-order-makes-self-isolation-mandatory-for-individuals-entering-canada.html). There are some individuals who are exempt from this order to provide essential services, but they still require a [self-isolation plan](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/self-isolation-on-return) and self-monitoring.
