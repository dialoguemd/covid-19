## British Columbia: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other respiratory illnesses, including the flu and common cold. They include cough, sneezing, fever, sore throat and difficulty breathing.

Contact your healthcare provider if you have developed symptoms and have been in close contact with someone known to have COVID-19. Do the same if you develop symptoms and have been in contact with a traveller returning from an affected area with widespread community spread of COVID-19.

Tell your health-care professional:

- your symptoms;
- where you have been travelling or living;
- if you had direct contact with animals (for example, if you visited a live animal market); and
- if you had close contact with a sick person, especially if they had a fever, cough or difficulty breathing.

Call ahead to the health-care facility you are planning to visit so they can be prepared to take precautions. In an emergency, describe your symptoms, travel history and any sick contacts when you first arrive at the facility so that appropriate precautions can be taken.

Until more is understood about the virus, older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are considered at higher risk of severe disease.

### I think that I have COVID-19, should I consult in person?

At this time we are asking patients to avoid going to the emergency department for novel coronavirus testing.

If you feel that you might have COVID-19, you can be tested at your primary care provider (family doctor or nurse practitioner's) office. Please call ahead to your primary care provider's office before you go to their clinic for assessment and testing. Calling ahead to the clinic before you go ensures that the clinic is prepared to test you and keeps the clinic’s staff and other visitors safe.

If you do not have a primary care provider, please call 8-1-1 for assessment. The nurses at 8-1-1 can give you more information regarding where you can go for assessment and testing, for example, an urgent primary care centre or a walk-in clinic.

Nurses at 8-1-1 have been instructed to complete an exposure risk assessment of callers with compatible symptoms, such as cough or influenza-like symptoms. In some cases, the 8-1-1 nurses may suggest a caller go see a healthcare provider for assessment and testing, and recommend that the caller call ahead to tell the clinicians that they are coming.

## What should I do if I have been travelling?

The Government now recommends that those returning from travel outside of Canada stay home and self-isolate for 14 days after they return. Monitor yourself daily for symptoms like fever, cough or difficulty breathing for these 14 days. If you develop symptoms, call 8-1-1 or speak with your health care provider to discuss any need for testing and follow up.

### How is the government ensuring that people who are told to self-isolate, actually self-isolate?

Public Health asks three groups of individuals to self-isolate. The first group are confirmed cases of novel coronavirus and a second group are asymptomatic close contacts of a confirmed novel coronavirus case and asymptomatic travelers from areas severely affected by coronavirus. These two groups are asked to self-isolate for 14 days and are called daily by a Public Health nurse who monitors their health, as well as behaviours (if they have been out in public). If individuals in these two groups do not self-isolate, Public Health can use legal powers under the Public Health Act to ensure that self-isolation occurs.

The third group asked to self-isolate are low risk individuals who are tested for novel coronavirus. These individuals are asked to self-isolate for typically 96 hours until they receive their novel coronavirus testing results.

The spread of novel coronavirus occurs with sustained close contact with an affected individual, for example, sitting in a car on a long trip, or living in the same household. Grocery stores – which are open and where people tend to walk around – are unlikely places to allow for virus spread.
