## British Columbia: What should I do if I think I have COVID-19?

If you develop cold, influenza or [COVID-19-like symptoms](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/about-covid-19/symptoms), go to the [testing page](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing) or use the [BC COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool](https://bc.thrive.health/) to help determine if you need further assessment for COVID-19 testing by a physician, nurse practitioner or at a local collection centre. You can complete this assessment for yourself, or on behalf of someone else, if they are unable to.

Go to the [If you are sick](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/about-covid-19/if-you-are-sick) page for details on how to stop the spread of germs, what to do if your symptoms get worse and ending self-isolation.

### I am returning to B.C., what do I need to do before arriving?

Unless you are [exempt](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/self-isolation-on-return#exempt), all international travellers returning to B.C. are required by law to [self-isolate](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation) for 14 days and complete a self-isolation plan. Travellers must submit a [B.C. self-isolation plan](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/self-isolation-on-return#complete-plan) and complete the [federal ArriveCAN](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/digital-tools.html) application prior to arrival or upon their return to B.C.

More informaiton is available on the [BC government website](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/self-isolation-on-return) for returning international travellers.

British Colubmians are encouraged to stay in their own communities and avoid non-essential travel at this time. As the province moves into phase 2 and phase 3 of B.C.'s Restart Plan, more guidance on travel within the province will be provided.

All returning travellers are encouraged to self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19. If you have questions, or you start to feel symptoms, contact your health care provider, 8-1-1, your local public health unit, or complete the COVID-19 Symptom Self-Assessment tool.
