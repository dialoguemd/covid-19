## British Columbia: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you have symptoms such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing and have travelled outside of Canada or have been exposed to someone who has COVID-19, avoid contact with others. See a health care provider as soon as possible.

If you are going to visit your health care provider, call them ahead of time so they can arrange for you to be assessed safely. Wear a mask in order to protect others. If you are unsure about what to do or have concerns or questions, contact HealthLinkBC (8-1-1) at any time or speak with your health care provider.

When seeing a health care provider, please tell them:

- Your symptoms
- Where you have been travelling or living
- If you had direct contact with animals (for example, if you visited a live animal market)
- If you had close contact with a sick person, especially if they had a fever, cough or difficulty breathing.

### I am a returning traveller, should I self-isolate or stay home from public spaces?

Those returning from travel outside of Canada should stay at home and self-isolate for 14 days after they have returned. Monitor yourself daily for symptoms like fever, cough or difficulty breathing for these 14 days. If you develop symptoms, call 8-1-1 or speak with your health care provider to discuss any need for testing and follow up.

People who have self-isolated can return to normal activities after 14 days if they have not developed any symptoms.
