## British Columbia: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you have symptoms such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing and have travelled outside of Canada or have been exposed to someone who has COVID-19, avoid contact with others. See a health care provider as soon as possible.

If you are going to visit your health care provider, call them ahead of time so they can arrange for you to be assessed safely. Wear a mask in order to protect others. If you are unsure about what to do or have concerns or questions, contact HealthLinkBC (8-1-1) at any time or speak with your health care provider.

When seeing a health care provider, please tell them:

- Your symptoms
- Where you have been travelling or living
- If you had direct contact with animals (for example, if you visited a live animal market)
- If you had close contact with a sick person, especially if they had a fever, cough or difficulty breathing.

### I think that I have COVID-19, can I come in to the emergency department to get tested?

At this time we are asking patients to avoid going to the emergency department for novel coronavirus testing.

If you feel that you might have COVID-19, you can be tested at your primary care provider (family doctor or nurse practitioner's) office. Please call ahead to your primary care provider's office before you go to their clinic for assessment and testing. Calling ahead to the clinic before you go ensures that the clinic is prepared to test you and keeps the clinic’s staff and other visitors safe.

If you do not have a primary care provider, please call 8-1-1 for assessment. The nurses at 8-1-1 can give you more information regarding where you can go for assessment and testing, for example, an urgent primary care centre or a walk-in clinic.

Nurses at 8-1-1 have been instructed to complete an exposure risk assessment of callers with compatible symptoms, such as cough or influenza-like symptoms. In some cases, the 8-1-1 nurses may suggest a caller go see a healthcare provider for assessment and testing, and recommend that the caller call ahead to tell the clinicians that they are coming.

## What should I do if I have been travelling?

The Government now recommends that those returning from travel outside of Canada stay home and self-isolate for 14 days after they return. Monitor yourself daily for symptoms like fever, cough or difficulty breathing for these 14 days. If you develop symptoms, call 8-1-1 or speak with your health care provider to discuss any need for testing and follow up.

### How is the government ensuring that people who are told to self-isolate, actually self-isolate? What if they were to go out in public, like to a local grocery store, would I be at risk?

The spread of novel coronavirus occurs with sustained close contact with an affected individual, for example, sitting in a car on a long trip, or living in the same household. Grocery stores – which are open and where people tend to walk around – are unlikely places to allow for virus spread

A number of groups are being asked to self-isolate

- Visitors to Canada and Canadians returning home. [Learn more here](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/common-questions).
- Those with known exposure to COVID-19
- Those with a confirmed case
  The second and third groups are monitored by Public Health, both their health and their activities. If people do not voluntarily self-isolate, Public Health can use legal powers under the Public Health Act to ensure that self-isolation occurs.
