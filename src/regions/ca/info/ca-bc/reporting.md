## British Columbia: What should I do if I think I have COVID-19?

If you develop cold, influenza or [COVID-19-like symptoms](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/about-covid-19/symptoms), use the [BC COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool](https://bc.thrive.health/) to help determine if you need further assessment for COVID-19 testing by a physician, nurse practitioner or at a local collection centre. You can complete this assessment for yourself, or on behalf of someone else, if they are unable to.

Go to the [If you are sick](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/about-covid-19/if-you-are-sick) page for details on how to stop the spread of germs, what to do if your symptoms get worse and ending self-isolation.

### I am a returning traveller, should I self-isolate?

Yes, you should self-isolate. Please visit our [self-isolation](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation) page to learn how long to self-isolate if you are a returning traveller.
