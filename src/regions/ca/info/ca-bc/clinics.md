## British Columbia: self-assessment tool

The Ministry of Health in partnership with Thrive Health created [this self-assessment tool](https://covid19.thrive.health/) to provide up-to-date guidance and recommendations for testing and follow-up for COVID-19 that follows BCCDC guidance. It is not a diagnostic tool and does not replace the advice of your healthcare provider.

Note that this self-assessment tool is intended for COVID-19 only. Your symptoms may not be related to COVID-19 and could require you to seek medical attention. If you are uncertain and/or feel very sick, contact your family doctor/nurse practitioner or call 8-1-1.
