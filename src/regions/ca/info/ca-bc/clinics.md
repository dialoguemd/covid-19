## British Columbia: self-assessment tool

[This self-assessment tool](https://covid19.thrive.health/), developed by the BC Ministry of Health, will help determine whether you may need further assessment or testing for COVID-19. You can complete this assessment for yourself, or on behalf of someone else, if they are unable to.
