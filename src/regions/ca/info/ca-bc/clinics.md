## British Columbia: self-assessment tool

[This self-assessment tool](https://covid19.thrive.health/), developed by the BC Ministry of Health, will help determine whether you may need further assessment for COVID-19 testing by a healthcare provider or at a local collection centre. You can complete this assessment for yourself, or on behalf of someone else.

Older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical conditions are considered at higher risk of severe disease. For more, see information for [priority populations](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/priority-populations).

Note that this self-assessment tool is intended for COVID-19 only. Your symptoms may not be related to COVID-19 and could require you to seek medical attention. If you are uncertain and/or feel very sick, contact your family doctor/nurse practitioner or call 8-1-1.
