## British Columbia: assessment

[This self-assessment tool](https://covid19.thrive.health/), developed by the BC Ministry of Health, will help determine whether you may need further assessment or testing for COVID-19. You can complete this assessment for yourself, or on behalf of someone else, if they are unable to.

### Test results

The BCCDC COVID-19 Negative Results line is staffed from 8:30AM to 4:30PM, seven days a week. People who have tested are asked to wait 72 hours before calling the Negative Results line. Most people who have been tested are calling before the 72 hours and, as a result, the line is experiencing an extremely high call and voicemail volume. We ask for your patience and to try calling back if it has been more than 72 hours since your test. If you have spoken with an operator or left a voicemail with your information, you have been placed in a queue and a nurse will follow-up when your result is ready. Please do not call back.

If someone tests positive, public health will contact them. However, while you wait for your test result, you should follow the advice of your doctor or testing provider to self-isolate.
