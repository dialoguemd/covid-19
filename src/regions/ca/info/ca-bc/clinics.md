## British Columbia: Specialized COVID-19 Clinics

As of Monday 09:00 PST, there will be a specialized COVID-19 screening site across from Royal Columbian Hospital. You can call 604-649-8824 or visit the [Division Virtual Clinic website](https://www.divisionsbc.ca/fraser-northwest/influenza-symptom-testing-center?utm_source=Fraser+Northwest+Division+Members&utm_campaign=a1844c851f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_03_12_11_43_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_916bba9feb-a1844c851f-137196041&mc_cid=a1844c851f#appointment).

It is important to call or book your appointment online so that the clinic is prepared to receive patients and limit the wait times in the clinic.

The clinic's goal is to reduce the burden on the community's physicians to keep them safe and healthy.
