## British Columbia: Specialized COVID-19 Clinics

As of Monday 09:00 PST, there will be a specialized COVID-19 screening site across from Royal Columbian Hospital. You can call 604-649-8824 or visit the [Division Virtual Clinic website](https://www.divisionsbc.ca/fraser-northwest/influenza-symptom-testing-center?utm_source=Fraser+Northwest+Division+Members&utm_campaign=a1844c851f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_03_12_11_43_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_916bba9feb-a1844c851f-137196041&mc_cid=a1844c851f#appointment).

It is important to call or book your appointment online so that the clinic is prepared to receive patients and limit the wait times in the clinic.

The clinic's goal is to reduce the burden on the community's physicians to keep them safe and healthy.

### Test results

The BCCDC COVID-19 Negative Results line is staffed from 8:30AM to 4:30PM, seven days a week. People who have tested are asked to wait 72 hours before calling the Negative Results line. Most people who have been tested are calling before the 72 hours and, as a result, the line is experiencing an extremely high call and voicemail volume. We ask for your patience and to try calling back if it has been more than 72 hours since your test.

If someone tests positive, public health will contact them. However, while you wait for your test result, you should follow the advice of your doctor or testing provider to self-isolate.
