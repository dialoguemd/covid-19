## Alberta: What Should I Do If I Think I Have COVID-19?

- If you have returned from travel outside of Canada or have been in close contact with a known case you MUST self-isolate for 14 days following your return/exposure and monitor yourself for symptoms.
- If you have symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, sore throat or runny nose, you MUST self-isolate for 10 days after the onset of symptoms and until your symptoms have resolved (whichever is longer).
- Complete the [COVID-19 online self-assessment](https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Journey/COVID-19/Pages/COVID-Self-Assessment.aspx) to determine if you should receive testing for COVID-19
- If you are quarantined because you recently came back from outside the country, or you are a close contact of a confirmed case of COVID, you must remain on your own property. Under no circumstance should you leave your property during the 14 days of self-isolation.
- Most of Alberta's family physicians are continuing to provide services during COVID-19.
- Patients should continue to consult with their family physician for non-urgent health concerns, including care for chronic conditions and any new health concerns unrelated to COVID-19.
- Please call your physician's office before attending in person to determine whether in-person or virtual care is the best option. If you do not have a family doctor, please visit [AlbertaFindADoctor.ca](https://albertafindadoctor.ca/).
- If your symptoms worsen, have concerns about your health or questions about COVID-19, call 811.
- Call 911 if you are seriously ill and need immediate medical attention. Inform them that you may have COVID-19.

If you are in mandatory self-isolation:

- Do not go outside for a walk through your neighbourhood or park. This includes children in mandatory self-isolation.
- You can get fresh air in your backyard, if you have one, but you must remain on private property not accessible by others.
- If you live in an apartment building or highrise, you must stay inside and cannot use the elevators or stairwells to go outside. If your balcony is private and at least 2 metres away from your closest neighbour's, you may go outside on the balcony.
- This directive is consistent with the new federal requirements under the Quarantine Act.

#### Info for Travellers

Returning to Alberta:

Effective March 25, the Government of Canada has implemented a mandatory 14-day quarantine, under the Quarantine Act, for travellers returning to Canada.

ALL travellers who returned to Alberta from outside Canada in the last 14 days are required to self-isolate immediately for 14 days after the date of return and monitor for symptoms.

If you are quarantined because you recently came back from outside the country, or you are a close contact of a confirmed case of COVID, you must remain on your own property. Under no circumstance should you leave your property during the 14 days of self-isolation.

If, at any time in your 14 day period of self-isolation, you develop symptoms of illness, you are required to stay home for 10 days from date of symptom onset, or until symptoms have cleared, whichever is longer. This may extend your period of self-isolation to longer than 14 days.

Albertans are NOT recommended to travel outside of the country at this time.

If you are unsure if you should be self-isolating, or if you have questions about how to do it, follow these [guidelines](https://www.alberta.ca/isolation.aspx) or call [Health Link 811](https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/info/Page12630.aspx).

Further information for travellers returning to work and school can be found on the [Alberta COVID-19 website](https://www.alberta.ca/coronavirus-info-for-albertans.aspx#p22780s6).
