## Alberta: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you have symptoms and recently travelled outside Canada or were exposed to someone who has COVID-19, stay home and call [Health Link 811](https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/healthinfo/link/index.html) for instructions. Do not go to the ER.

If you need immediate medical attention, call 911 and inform them that you may have COVID-19.

## Should I change or cancel my travel plans outside of Canada?

- Travel outside of Canada is not recommended at this time.
- Given the rapid global spread of COVID-19, it is no longer possible to assess health risks for the duration
  of the trip.

## What should I do if I have recently returned from travelling outside of Canada?

Effective March 12, all Albertans currently outside of the country, or who have recently returned, are
recommended to self-isolate on their return for 14 days, independent of the country they were visiting.
You can do this by following [these guidelines](https://www.alberta.ca/assets/documents/health-selfisolation-information-sheet.pdf), which include:

- Avoid close contact with other people, especially those with chronic conditions, a compromised
  immune system, or seniors.
- Do not attend work, school, social events or any other public gatherings.
- Watch for symptoms like fever, cough or shortness of breath in yourself or family members.
- Call Health Link 811 at the first sign of symptoms. Call from home before going to a health care
  facility, unless severely ill.
- If severely ill and in need of immediate medical attention call 911 and inform them that you may
  have COVID-19.

If you are unsure if you should be self-isolating, or if you have questions about how to do it, follow these
guidelines or call Health Link 811.
