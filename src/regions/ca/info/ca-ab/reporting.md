## Alberta: What Should I Do If I Think I Have COVID-19?

- If you have returned from travel outside of Canada or have been in close contact with a known case you MUST self-isolate for 14 days following your return/exposure and monitor yourself for symptoms.
- If you have symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, sore throat or runny nose, you MUST self-isolate for 10 days after the onset of symptoms and until your symptoms have resolved (whichever is longer).
- Complete the [COVID-19 online self-assessment](https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Journey/COVID-19/Pages/COVID-Self-Assessment.aspx) to determine if you should receive testing for COVID-19
- If you are quarantined because you recently came back from outside the country, or you are a close contact of a confirmed case of COVID, you must remain on your own property. Under no circumstance should you leave your property during the 14 days of self-isolation.
- Please do not visit a hospital, physicianâ€™s office, lab or healthcare facility without consulting Health Link 811 first.
- If your symptoms worsen, call 811. We are experiencing heavy call volumes and will get to your call as quickly as we can.
- Call 911 if you are seriously ill and need immediate medical attention. Inform them that you may have COVID-19.

If you are in mandatory self-isolation:

- Do not go outside for a walk through your neighbourhood or park. This includes children in mandatory self-isolation.
- You can get fresh air in your backyard, if you have one, but you must remain on private property not accessible by others.
- If you live in an apartment building or highrise, you must stay inside and cannot use the elevators or stairwells to go outside. If your balcony is private and at least 2 metres away from your closest neighbour's, you may go outside on the balcony.
- This directive is consistent with the new federal requirements under the Quarantine Act.

#### Info for Travellers

Returning to Alberta:

Effective March 25, the Government of Canada has implemented a mandatory 14-day quarantine, under the Quarantine Act, for travellers returning to Canada.

ALL travellers who returned to Alberta from outside Canada in the last 14 days are required to self-isolate immediately for 14 days after the date of return and monitor for symptoms.

If you are quarantined because you recently came back from outside the country, or you are a close contact of a confirmed case of COVID, you must remain on your own property. Under no circumstance should you leave your property during the 14 days of self-isolation.

Albertans are NOT recommended to travel outside of the country at this time.
