## Alberta: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you have COVID-19 symptoms and have travelled outside Canada or were exposed to someone who has COVID-19, stay home and call Health Link 811 for instructions.

Do not go to a health care facility without consulting 811 first. If you need immediate medical attention, call 911 and inform them that you you may have COVID-19.
