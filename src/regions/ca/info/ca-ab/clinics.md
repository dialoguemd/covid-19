## Alberta: Online assessment tool

Use this [self-assessment tool](https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Journey/COVID-19/Pages/COVID-Self-Assessment.aspx) to help determine whether you need be tested for COVID-19. You can complete this assessment for yourself or on behalf of someone else, if they are not able.

The COVID-19 test is only for people who currently have symptoms of the virus. The test does not show if you were infected in the past and are no longer symptomatic.
