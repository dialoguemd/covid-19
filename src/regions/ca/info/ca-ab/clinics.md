## Alberta: Online assessment tool

Use this [self-assessment tool](https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Journey/COVID-19/Pages/COVID-Self-Assessment.aspx) to help determine whether you need be tested for COVID-19 or if you would like to be voluntarily tested. You can complete this assessment for yourself or on behalf of someone else, if they are not able.

Testing will tell you whether you have COVID-19 at the time of your test, even if you are not showing symptoms.Testing will not tell you whether you have previously had COVID-19. It will also not tell you whether or not you have any immunity to COVID-19.
