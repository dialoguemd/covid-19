## Alberta: Online asessment tool

Use this [self-assessment tool](https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Journey/COVID-19/Pages/COVID-Self-Assessment.aspx) to help determine whether you need be tested for COVID-19. You can complete this assessment for yourself or on behalf of someone else, if they are not able.

If you are a healthcare worker and you think you may have or may have been exposed to COVID-19, please use this [Healthcare Worker Self-Assessment Tool](https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Journey/COVID-19/Pages/HWAssessLanding.aspx).
