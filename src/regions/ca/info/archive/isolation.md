## Self-isolation

Self-isolation means avoiding situations where you could infect other people.

This means all situations where you may come in contact with others, such as social gatherings, work, school/university, child care, athletic events, faith-based gatherings, healthcare facilities, grocery stores, restaurants, shopping malls, and any public gatherings.

You should, (where possible) not use public transportation including buses, taxis, or ride sharing.

As much as possible, you should limit your contact with people and avoid having visitors to your home, but it is okay for friends, family or delivery drivers to drop off food or other things you may need.

You can also use delivery or pick up services for errands such as grocery shopping.

If you need to leave your home for an urgent errand, such as picking up essential medication, as a precaution to further reduce risk of spread, you can wear a surgical mask while you are out.
