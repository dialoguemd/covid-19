## What have we learned from countries like China, South Korea and Singapore that have been dealing with this for a longer period of time and have slowed the spread?

As countries in Asia were hit first by COVID-19, they implemented several processes that helped them slow down the spread. In China, the rapid and strict implementation of isolation measures (suspension of airport, railways, transit systems, travel restrictions , and home-isolation among others) helped to dramatically slow down the spread of COVID-19. In South Korea, the spread was slowed down without resorting to lockdowns. The country has a large testing capacity that allows the government to test everyone rapidly. Furthermore, information is communicated to the population through cell-phones alert.
