## How long can a patient keep the virus/remain contagious for?

For the moment, medical experts do not know exactly for how long a patient may keep the virus or remain contagious. However, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/care-for-someone.html) does have some guidelines. People with COVID-19 who have stayed home (are home isolated) can stop home isolation under the following conditions:

-If they will not have a test to determine if they are still contagious, they can leave home after these three things have happened:

They have had no fever for at least 72 hours (that is three full days of no fever without the use medicine that reduces fevers)
AND
other symptoms have improved (for example, when their cough or shortness of breath have improved)
AND
at least 7 days have passed since their symptoms first appeared

- If they will be tested to determine if they are still contagious, they can leave home after these three things have happened:

They no longer have a fever (without the use medicine that reduces fevers)
AND
other symptoms have improved (for example, when their cough or shortness of breath have improved)
AND
They received two negative tests in a row, 24 hours apart. Their doctor will follow CDC guidelines.
