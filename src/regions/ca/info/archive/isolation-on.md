## Self-isolation

If you returned from an affected area, you may need to self-isolate for 14 days. You may have been exposed to the 2019 novel coronavirus during your travels and staying home and limiting contact with others can help prevent further spread. Please contact your [local public health unit](http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/phu/locations.aspx) for advice.

If you need immediate medical attention you should call 911 and mention your travel history and symptoms.
