## Nova Scotia: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If there is a need for in-person assessment, 811 will refer to a COVID-19 assessment centre and you will be contacted for an appointment.

Please do not go to a COVID-19 assessment centre without having been referred by 811.

Those directed to an assessment centre by 811 will then have a physical assessment on site and based on that a swab will be taken for patients for whom it is appropriate.

**If youâ€™ve travelled**

The Government of Canada has issued an official travel advisory asking Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside Canada until further notice.

The Province of Nova Scotia, under the authority of the Health Protection Act, is requiring anyone who has travelled outside Nova Scotia to self-isolate for 14 days from the day they get back to the province, even if they do not have symptoms. Public health inspectors will be onsite at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport and the J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport.
