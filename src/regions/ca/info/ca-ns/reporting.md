## Nova Scotia: If you think you might have been exposed to COVID-19

If you have any one of the COVID-19 symptoms, or any other symptoms that concern you, call 811 for assessment by a nurse.

Nova Scotia Health Authority has established [COVID-19 assessment centres](http://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus-assessment). If you need in-person assessment, 811 will refer you to a centre. Don't go to a COVID-19 assessment centre unless 811 referred you.

**If you’ve travelled**

The Government of Nova Scotia, under the authority of the Health Protection Act, requires anyone who has travelled outside Nova Scotia to self-isolate for 14 days from the day they get back to the province, even if they don't have symptoms.
