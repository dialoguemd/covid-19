## Nova Scotia: If you think you might have been exposed to COVID-19

If you have any one of the [COVID-19 symptoms](https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/when-to-seek-help/#symptoms), or any other symptoms that concern you, call 811 for assessment by a nurse.

Nova Scotia Health Authority has established [COVID-19 assessment centres](http://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus-assessment). If you need in-person assessment, 811 will refer you to a centre (don't go to a COVID-19 assessment centre unless 811 referred you).

Travel within Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador is permitted without the requirement to self-isolate for Atlantic Canadian residents. If you live in an Atlantic Canadian province, you need to show proof of residency when you enter Nova Scotia. You don’t need to complete a Nova Scotia Safe Check-in Form before you travel to the province.

When Atlantic Canadians arrive in Nova Scotia, every adult needs to provide government-issued identification (like a Driver's Licence or Health Card) or a utility bill or bank statement that shows their permanent home address. Atlantic Canadians also need to follow public health directives while they're in Nova Scotia.

People from outside Atlantic Canada who have already self-isolated in another Atlantic Canadian province for 14 days, may enter Nova Scotia without self-isolating again. They don’t need to complete a Nova Scotia Safe Check-in Form before they travel to the province.
