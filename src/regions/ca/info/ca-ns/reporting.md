## Nova Scotia: If you think you might have been exposed to COVID-19

If you have any one of the [COVID-19 symptoms](https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/when-to-seek-help/#symptoms), or any other symptoms that concern you, call 811 for assessment by a nurse.

Nova Scotia Health Authority has established [COVID-19 assessment centres](http://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus-assessment). If you need in-person assessment, 811 will refer you to a centre (don't go to a COVID-19 assessment centre unless 811 referred you).

All persons from outside Atlantic Canada entering Nova Scotia (including post-secondary students and persons passing through Nova Scotia on their way to another province) are required to isolate themselves for 14 days upon arrival in Nova Scotia (or for the duration of their stay if less than 14 days). If they have already been in isolation in another province in Atlantic Canada, they can come to Nova Scotia without having to be isolated again. They do not have to be isolated if they are exempt from the isolation requirements.
