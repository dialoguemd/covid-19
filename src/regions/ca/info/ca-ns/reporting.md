## Nova Scotia: If you think you might have been exposed to COVID-19

If you have 2 or more symptoms (fever, a new cough or a cough that's getting worse, sore throat, runny nose or headache), call 811 for further assessment by a nurse.

Not everyone who has concerns about COVID-19 needs to call 811. To find out if you need to call, visit [When to call 811 about COVID-19](https://when-to-call-about-covid19.novascotia.ca/en).

Nova Scotia Health Authority has established [COVID-19 assessment centres](http://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus-assessment). If you need in-person assessment, 811 will refer you to a centre. Don't go to a COVID-19 assessment centre unless 811 referred you.

**If youâ€™ve travelled**

The Government of Nova Scotia, under the authority of the Health Protection Act, requires anyone who has travelled outside Nova Scotia to self-isolate for 14 days from the day they get back to the province, even if they don't have symptoms.
