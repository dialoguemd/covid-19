## Nova Scotia: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Not everyone who has concerns about COVID-19 needs to call 811. To find out if you need to call, visit [811’s website](https://when-to-call-about-covid19.novascotia.ca/en).

Nova Scotia Health Authority has established [COVID-19 assessment centres](http://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus-assessment). If you need in-person assessment, 811 will refer you to a centre. Don't go to a COVID-19 assessment centre unless 811 referred you.

**If you’ve travelled**

The Province of Nova Scotia, under the authority of the Health Protection Act, is requiring anyone who has travelled outside Nova Scotia to self-isolate for 14 days from the day they get back to the province, even if they do not have symptoms.
