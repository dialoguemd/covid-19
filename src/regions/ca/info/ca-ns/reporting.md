## Nova Scotia: If you think you might have been exposed to COVID-19

You should also call 811 for assessment if you think you've been exposed to COVID-19 or have any other symptoms that concern you.

If the assessment determines that you need a test, Nova Scotia Health Authority or IWK Health Centre will call you within 1 to 2 days to book the testing appointment.

Testing

Nova Scotia Health Authority has established COVID-19 assessment centres. If you need a test, Nova Scotia Health Authority or IWK Health Centre will call you to book an appointment (don't go to a COVID-19 assessment centre unless you're referred).

If you’re referred for COVID-19 testing you need to self-isolate right away. People you live with don’t need to self-isolate unless they become unwell, have been told by Public Health that they need to self-isolate or are required to self-isolate for other reasons. They need to monitor their symptoms closely and self-isolate if they start to feel sick.

If your child is referred for COVID-19 testing they need to self-isolate right away. Other people in the home (including if they’re caring for the child) don’t need to self-isolate unless they become unwell, have been told by Public Health that they need to self-isolate or are required to self-isolate for other reasons. They need to monitor their symptoms closely and self-isolate if they start to feel sick.

After testing, you’re legally required to self-isolate for 14 days if you:

- are waiting for your COVID-19 test results
- have tested positive for COVID-19
- have tested negative for COVID-19, but had close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19

Travel within Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador is permitted without the requirement to self-isolate for Atlantic Canadian residents. If you live in an Atlantic Canadian province, you need to show proof of residency when you enter Nova Scotia. You don’t need to complete a Nova Scotia Safe Check-in Form before you travel to the province.

When Atlantic Canadians arrive in Nova Scotia, every adult needs to provide government-issued identification (like a Driver's Licence or Health Card) or a utility bill or bank statement that shows their permanent home address. Atlantic Canadians also need to follow public health directives while they're in Nova Scotia.

People from outside Atlantic Canada who have already self-isolated in another Atlantic Canadian province for 14 days, may enter Nova Scotia without self-isolating again. They don’t need to complete a Nova Scotia Safe Check-in Form before they travel to the province.
