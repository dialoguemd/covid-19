## Nova Scotia: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

**If you’ve travelled**

The Province of Nova Scotia, under the authority of the Health Protection Act, is requiring anyone who has travelled outside Canada to self-isolate for 14 days from the day they get back to Canada. You must self-isolate even if you don’t have symptoms.

If you’ve travelled recently and you develop a fever, with a temperature 38°C or higher, or a cough, you should call 811 for assessment.

**When to call 811**

Not everyone who has concerns about COVID-19 needs to call 811. To find out if you need to call, use the COVID-19 online self-assessment.

**Testing**

Nova Scotia Health Authority has established COVID-19 assessment centres. If you need in-person assessment, 811 will refer you to a centre. Don't go to a COVID-19 assessment centre unless 811 referred you.
