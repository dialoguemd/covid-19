## Nova Scotia: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you've travelled outside Canada, you may have come in contact with the novel coronavirus. If you start to feel unwell, you should self isolate – this means staying home, away from the public.

The Province of Nova Scotia, under the authority of the Health Protection Act, is requiring anyone who has travelled outside Canada to self-isolate for 14 days upon return, even if you are symptom-free.

If you develop a fever, with a temperature 38°C or higher, or a cough, you should call 811 for assessment.

Nova Scotia Health Authority has established [COVID-19 assessment centres](http://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus). If you need in-person assessment, 811 will refer you to a centre. Don't go to a COVID-19 assessment centre unless 811 referred you.

To help you better understand if you need to talk to 811, please review [this simple questionnaire](https://811.novascotia.ca/health_topics/covid-19-when-to-call-811/).

If you've been directed to self-isolate, you can get information from [Nova Scotia Health Authority Public Health](http://www.nshealth.ca/public-health-offices) by contacting the nearest office.
