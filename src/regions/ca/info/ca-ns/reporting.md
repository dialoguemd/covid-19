## Nova Scotia: If you think you might have been exposed to COVID-19

If you have any one of the [COVID-19 symptoms](https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/when-to-seek-help/#symptoms), or any other symptoms that concern you, call 811 for assessment by a nurse.

Nova Scotia Health Authority has established [COVID-19 assessment centres](http://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus-assessment). If you need in-person assessment, 811 will refer you to a centre (don't go to a COVID-19 assessment centre unless 811 referred you).
