## Nova Scotia: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you've travelled outside Canada, you may have come in contact with the novel coronavirus. If you start to feel unwell, you should self isolate – this means staying home, away from the public.

Upon returning to Canada, you will be instructed at border entry points and through public messaging to monitor your health for 14 days from the day you entered Canada and minimize your contact with individuals who are at high risk of severe COVID-19 illness.

If you've travelled to Italy, Iran, and Hubei Province in China, you are asked to self-isolate for 14 days from the day you entered Canada.

If you develop a fever, with a temperature 38°C or higher, or a cough, you should call 811 for assessment.

Nova Scotia Health Authority has established [COVID-19 assessment centres](http://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus). If you need in-person assessment, 811 will refer you to a centre. Don't go to a COVID-19 assessment centre unless 811 referred you.

To help you better understand if you need to talk to 811, please review [this simple questionnaire](https://811.novascotia.ca/health_topics/covid-19-when-to-call-811/).

If you've been directed to self-isolate, you can get information from [Nova Scotia Health Authority Public Health](http://www.nshealth.ca/public-health-offices) by contacting the nearest office.
