## Nova Scotia: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

**If youâ€™ve travelled**

The Government of Canada has issued an official travel advisory asking Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside Canada until further notice.

The Province of Nova Scotia, under the authority of the Health Protection Act, is requiring anyone who has travelled outside Canada to self-isolate for 14 days upon return, even if you are symptom-free.

Anyone who travels outside Canada may come in contact with the novel coronavirus. Travellers are reminded to follow health precautions like washing their hands often, avoiding contact with persons who are sick, and practicing proper cough and sneeze etiquette.

If you or a family member chooses to travel outside Canada with these restrictions in place, please consider if:

- the Government of Canada has issued a travel health notice for the country or region you plan to visit
- you or a family member have a compromised immune system
- you have, or can get, appropriate travel insurance in case you become sick while away

The Public Health Agency of Canada is recommending that Canadians avoid all cruise ship travel due to COVID-19 because the virus can spread quickly on ships due to the close contact between passengers.

**When to call 811**

Not everyone who has concerns about COVID-19 needs to call 811. To find out if you need to call, use the [COVID-19 online self-assessment](https://when-to-call-about-covid19.novascotia.ca/en).

**Testing**

Nova Scotia Health Authority has established COVID-19 assessment centres. If you need in-person assessment, 811 will refer you to a centre. Don't go to a COVID-19 assessment centre unless 811 referred you.
