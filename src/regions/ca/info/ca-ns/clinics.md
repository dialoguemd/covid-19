## Nova Scotia: Specialized COVID-19 Clinics

Nova Scotians who have travelled out of country and who develop a fever with a temperature of 38Â°C or higher, and/or cough, should use this [screening tool](https://when-to-call-about-covid19.novascotia.ca/en) to find out if you should call 811 about COVID-19.

If there is a need for in-person assessment, 811 will refer to a [COVID-19 assessment centres](http://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus) and you will be contacted for an appointment.

Please do not go to a COVID-19 assessment centre without having been referred by 811.

Those directed to an assessment centre by 811 will then have a physical assessment on site and based on that a swab will be taken for patients for whom it is appropriate.
