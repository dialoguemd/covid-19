# Nova Scotia: Specialized COVID-19 Clinics

Nova Scotians who have travelled out of country and who develop a fever with a temperature of 38°C or higher, and/or cough, should call 811.

811 will provide direction on what to do next. If there is a need for in-person assessment, 811 will refer to a [COVID-19 assessment centres](http://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus).

Please do not go to a COVID-19 assessment centre without having been referred by 811. We are working to be able to book specific appointment times in the coming days.

Those directed to an assessment centre by 811 will then have a physical assessment on site and based on that a swab will be taken for patients for whom it is appropriate.
