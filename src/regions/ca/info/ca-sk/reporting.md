## Saskatchewan: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Please note: You do not need to be tested for COVID-19 if in the past 14 days you have not travelled outside Canada or had contact with someone diagnosed as having COVID-19.

If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, get tested. Symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath and generally feeling unwell. Use this self-assessment tool to determine if you should be tested for COVID-19.
If you fit the criteria of potential exposure, are exhibiting mild symptoms and suspect you may have COVID-19, you can obtain a referral to a community testing centre by phoning:

- HealthLine 811.
- Your local Public Health Communicable Disease Control office.
- Your family physician.

Testing centres have been set up across the province. They are for referrals only and not for walk-in testing. The testing centres will only provide testing. They are not for patient care. If you are not exhibiting symptoms, you do not need to be tested. Detailed information on COVID-19 symptoms and care management can be found at saskatchewan.ca/coronavirus.
If you have recently travelled internationally and are experiencing respiratory or flu-like symptoms, please call HealthLine 811.

All residents should be familiar with self-monitoring and self-isolation precautions in order to keep you and those around you safe.

If you have no symptoms or exposure concerns, but have questions about COVID-19, you can:
