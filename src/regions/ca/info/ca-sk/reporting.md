## Saskatchewan: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Please note: You do not need to be tested for COVID-19 if in the past 14 days you have not travelled outside Canada or had contact with someone diagnosed as having COVID-19. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

All residents should be familiar with self-monitoring and self-isolation precautions in order to keep you and those around you safe.

If you have no symptoms or exposure concerns, but have questions about COVID-19, you can:

- Access the most up-to-date news and information on www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19
- Email COVID19@health.gov.sk.ca

As with most respiratory illnesses, most people with COVID-19 illness will recover on their own. There is no specific treatment for disease caused by COVID-19. Severe or worsening symptoms may require supportive treatment in hospital.

If symptoms feel worse than a standard cold, see a health care provider or call HealthLine at 811. If HealthLine 811 recommends you seek acute care, they will provide instruction to call ahead.

Additionally, Saskatchewan has launched its own self-assessment tool [here](https://saskatchewan.ca/coronavirus#utm_campaign=q2_2015&utm_medium=short&utm_source=%2Fcoronavirus).
