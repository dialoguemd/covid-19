## Saskatchewan: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, get tested. Symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath and generally feeling unwell. Use this self-assessment tool to determine if you should be tested for COVID-19.

If you fit the criteria of potential exposure, are exhibiting mild symptoms and suspect you may have COVID-19, you can obtain a referral to a community testing centre by phoning:

HealthLine 811.
- Your local Public Health Communicable Disease Control office.
- Your family physician.
- Your nurse practitioner.
