## Saskatchewan: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Like most respiratory illnesses, most people with common coronavirus illness will recover on their own. There is no specific treatment for disease caused by a novel coronavirus. However, many of the symptoms can and should be treated. If symptoms feel worse than a standard cold, see a health care provider or call Healthline at 811.

If you are planning to see your health care provider or go to the emergency room, please call ahead and explain your symptoms and travel history so they can make appropriate safety accommodations. If HealthLine 811 recommends you seek acute care, they will provide instruction to call ahead.

If you have symptoms and recently traveled outside Canada or were exposed to someone who has COVID-19, stay home and call HealthLine 811 for instructions. Do not go to an ER or clinic. If your symptoms worsen or you need immediate medical attention, call 911.

Additionally, Saskatchewan has launched its own self-assessment tool [here](https://saskatchewan.ca/coronavirus#utm_campaign=q2_2015&utm_medium=short&utm_source=%2Fcoronavirus).

### Travel guidance:

The Public Health Agency of Canada is recommending residents postpone or cancel all non-essential travel outside of Canada. All travellers are being asked to self-isolate for 14 days after returning to Canada as a precaution.
