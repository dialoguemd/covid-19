## Saskatchewan: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. All residents should be familiar with self-monitoring and self-isolation precautions in order to keep you and those around you safe.

A referral is required to get tested. You do not need to have travelled internationally to get a referral for testing. If you are not exhibiting symptoms, you do not need to be tested. You can obtain a referral to a community testing centre by phoning:

- HealthLine 811.
- Your local Public Health Communicable Disease Control office.
- Your family physician.
- Your nurse practitioner.

## Travel Information

The federal government and Saskatchewan's Chief Medical Health Officer recommend returning to Canada and avoiding non-essential international travel until further notice.

When you return to the province after a period of time in another country, including the United States, it is mandatory to take the following measures:

- Self-isolate for 14 days.
- Self-monitor for respiratory or flu-like symptoms for 14 days.
- Consider preparations you can make in advance to ensure your comfort during this 14-day period.
- Avoid visiting a long-term care facility or hospital.
- Call HealthLine 811 if you develop respiratory or flu-like symptoms.
