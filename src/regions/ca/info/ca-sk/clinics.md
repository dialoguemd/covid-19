## Saskatchewan: Online self-assessment tool

Use this [self-assessment tool](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/treatment-procedures-and-guidelines/emerging-public-health-issues/2019-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-self-assessment) to determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19.
You can complete this assessment for yourself or on behalf of someone else, if they are not able.

You no longer need to have travelled internationally to get a referral for testing.
