## Saskatchewan: Specialized COVID-19 Clinics

Starting Friday, March 13, the Saskatchewan Health Authority have opened their first two testing centres for COVID-19 in Regina and Saskatoon. A testing centre in Prince Albert is scheduled to open on Monday March 16.

These testing centres are for **referrals only and not for walk-in testing**. Patients who are fit criteria of potential exposure, exhibiting mild symptoms and suspect they may have COVID-19 can obtain a referral to the community testing centre by phoning:

- Your family physician
- HealthLine 811
- Your local Public Health Communicable Disease Control office.

The testing centres will only provide testing. These are not for patient care.

If you are not exhibiting symptoms, you do **not** need to be tested.
