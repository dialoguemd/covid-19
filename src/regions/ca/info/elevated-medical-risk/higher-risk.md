## üë¥üèª People at higher risk for COVID-19 complications

The Government of Canada [states](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html) that older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are at a higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19.

While most people with COVID-19 will be able to recover at home, people who are at higher risk who develop symptoms of COVID-19 should seek medical advice sooner than people who are younger and/or otherwise healthy.

While diseases can make anyone sick, some Canadians are more at risk of getting an infection and developing severe complications due to their health, social and economic circumstances.

### Vulnerable populations may include

#### Anyone who is:

- an older adult
- at risk due to underlying medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer)
- at risk due to a compromised immune system from a medical condition or treatment (e.g. chemotherapy)

#### Anyone who has:

- difficulty reading, speaking, understanding or communicating
- difficulty accessing medical care or health advice
- difficulty doing preventive activities, like frequent hand washing and covering coughs and sneezes
- ongoing specialized medical care or needs specific medical supplies
- ongoing supervision needs or support for maintaining independence
- difficulty accessing transportation
- economic barriers
- unstable employment or inflexible working conditions
- social or geographic isolation, like in remote and isolated communities
- insecure, inadequate, or nonexistent housing conditions
