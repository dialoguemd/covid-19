## Quebec: Specialized COVID-19 Clinics

### Montreal area

The clinic is accessible by appointment only.

The first specialized COVID-19 clinic, Centre-Sud site, is opened in Montréal’s former Hôtel-Dieu hospital. According to this [source](https://globalnews.ca/news/6654510/quebec-coronavirus-clinics-how-they-work/), another clinic in the Montérégie region will open early next week.

The specialized COVID-19 clinic is a complementary measure for cases that are not serious. The specialized clinic is designed to support hospitals, family medicine clinics and public health teams. It will curb overcrowding in emergency departments and prevent sick people from going to medical clinics.

At the specialized clinic, strict preventive measures are in place to protect staff, users and the general population. Individuals are checked upon entering the clinic and steps have been taken to safely transport users.

If you think you have COVID-19 infection, call Info-Santé at 811 first. A nurse will assess your situation and recommend what to do next. If a medical consultation in a specialized COVID-19 clinic is required, the Info-Santé nurse will book an appointment for you. If your state of health indicates that you require hospitalization, the Jewish General (adults) and Sainte-Justine’s (children) are the hospitals designated to treat confirmed cases
