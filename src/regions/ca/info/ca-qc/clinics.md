## Quebec: Specialized COVID-19 Clinics and Hospitals

### üìç Montreal area

#### Clinics for adults

The clinic is accessible by appointment only.

The first specialized COVID-19 clinic, Centre-Sud site, is opened in Montr√©al‚Äôs former H√¥tel-Dieu hospital. According to this [source](https://globalnews.ca/news/6654510/quebec-coronavirus-clinics-how-they-work/), another clinic in the Mont√©r√©gie region will open early next week.

The specialized COVID-19 clinic is a complementary measure for cases that are not serious. The specialized clinic is designed to support hospitals, family medicine clinics and public health teams. It will curb overcrowding in emergency departments and prevent sick people from going to medical clinics.

At the specialized clinic, strict preventive measures are in place to protect staff, users and the general population. Individuals are checked upon entering the clinic and steps have been taken to safely transport users.

If you think you have COVID-19 infection, call 1 877 644-4545, toll free, first. A nurse will assess your situation and recommend what to do next. If a medical consultation in a specialized COVID-19 clinic is required, the Info-Sant√© nurse will book an appointment for you. If your state of health indicates that you require hospitalization, the Jewish General (adults) and Sainte-Justine‚Äôs (children) are the hospitals designated to treat confirmed cases

#### Clinics for children

Sainte-Justine Hospital wishes to inform the public that it is implementing an electronic form to prioritize access to an appointment at its COVID-19 screening clinic for children returning from travel with symptoms.

This online form is only for families with children returning from travel who have symptoms that may be similar to those associated with COVID-19, such as fever, respiratory problems and/or cough.

To obtain an appointment at the COVID-19 screening clinic at Sainte-Justine UHC, visit their website to complete the [online form](https://www.chusj.org/Calendrier-salle-presse/nouvelles/actualites/2020/outil-en-ligne-despistage-covid19-coronavirus) (available only in French).

For those who have already used the Quebec government telephone line (1 877 644-4545) or 811, please do not use this online service, which is intended to be complementary.

Sainte-Justine Hospital also asks all visitors presenting symptoms associated with COVID-19, who have travelled outside the country in the last 14 days or who have been in contact with a diagnosed person, to avoid going to its facilities.
