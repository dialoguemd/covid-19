## Quebec: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

On march 13, 2020, the Gouvernement du Québec adopted an Order in Council that declares a health emergency throughout Québec’s territory. This exceptional measure empowers the government to implement an array of measures to protect the health of the population.

Special attention must be paid to the elderly, especially individuals 70 years of age and over, since they are at greater risk of complications.

If you are worried about COVID‑19 or display symptoms such as a cough or fever, you can call toll free 418-644-4545 in the Québec City region, 514-644-4545 in the Montréal area, 450-644-4545 in the Montérégie region, 819-644-4545 in the Outaouais region and 1-877-644-4545 elsewhere in Québec.

If you have symptoms such as a cough or fever:

- Do not go to a medical clinic unless you have first obtained an appointment.
- Visit the emergency room only if you have difficulty breathing (difficulty breathing at rest or unable to breathe while lying down).
