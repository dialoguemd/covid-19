## Quebec: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

### For citizens returning from travel:

A 14 days [voluntary isolation](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/interim-guidance-cases-contacts.html#si) is recommended for all persons returning from abroad as of March 12, 2020. They should be vigilant and monitor their symptoms.

### For citizens who do not return from a trip but who show symptoms:

All persons who, as of March 12, 2020, have symptoms associated with the flu or cold should place themselves in [voluntary isolation](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/interim-guidance-cases-contacts.html#si) for 14 days.

People who are in doubt about their health status may first contact Info-Santé 811. A nurse will assess the situation and give the appropriate instructions.
