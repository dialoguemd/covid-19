## Québec: Self-Care Guide - COVID-19

The [Self-Care Guide](https://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/en/document-002492/) is designed to help each individual make the best possible decisions regarding their own health and that of their families during the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it sets down the best means for protection against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and provides information about self-care, basic care for family members, and information about when and where to consult a doctor, if medical care is required.

## Quebec: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you are worried about COVID‑19 or display symptoms such as a cough or fever, you can call 418-644-4545 in the Québec City region, 514-644-4545 in the Montréal area, 450-644-4545 in the Montérégie region, 819-644-4545 in the Outaouais region and 1-877-644-4545 (toll free) elsewhere in Québec.

If you have symptoms such as a cough or fever:

- Do not go to a medical clinic unless you have first obtained an appointment.
- If your condition allows you to do so, call 1-877-644-4545. If you are a traveller who has returned within less than 14 days, mention it.
- Visit the emergency room only if you have difficulty breathing (you have difficulty breathing when resting or are unable to breathe when lying down).

In addition, a walk-in screening clinic at the [CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal](https://santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public/coronavirus-covid-19/) is opening to increase the number of screening tests.

## What should I do if I am returning from abroad?

- You are in self-isolation because you returned from travelling abroad on or after March 12, 2020.

OR

- You are under mandatory self-isolation because you are a public sector employee or a public or private health care, education and daycare worker returning from abroad on or after March 12, 2020.

Following these instructions and self-isolating for 14 days after returning from travelling abroad can make all the difference to slow transmission of COVID-19. These instructions are unusual and restrictive, especially if you have young children or are a caregiver.

However, by following these instructions, people around you can avoid getting COVID-19, if ever you are carrying the virus and develop symptoms.
