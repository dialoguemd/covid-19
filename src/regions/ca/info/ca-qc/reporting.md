## Quebec: COVID-19 Online Evaluation Questionnaire and Self-Care Guide - COVID-19

Anyone, registered or not registered with a family doctor, who has symptoms and who has, or thinks they have, a need for family medicine consultation in order to obtain a clinical evaluation by a nurse and be referred as necessary to the appropriate resource should telephone 1 877 644-4545. As a result, screening and assessment forms are no longer accessible. However, follow-up will be done for all requests being processed. For Service Quebec workers, please refer to your supervisor for more information.

The [Self-Care Guide](https://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/en/document-002492/) is designed to help each individual make the best possible decisions regarding their own health and that of their families during the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it sets down the best means for protection against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and provides information about self-care, basic care for family members, and information about when and where to consult a doctor, if medical care is required.

## Quebec: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you are worried about COVID‑19 or if you have [flu-like symptoms](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/flu-cold-and-gastroenteritis/flu-influenza/#c1285) or [gastroenteritis symptoms](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/flu-cold-and-gastroenteritis/gastroenteritis/#c1816) or similar to [COVID‑19](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/general-information-about-coronavirus/#c46539), you can call 418-644-4545, 514-644-4545, 450-644-4545, 819-644-4545 and 1-877-644-4545 (toll free) elsewhere in Québec. For the hearing impaired (TTY), call 1-800-361 9596 (toll free).

- For testing and evaluation in Montréal, visit this [santemontreal.qc.ca](https://santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public/coronavirus-covid-19/#c37517).

If you have these symptoms:

- Do not go to a medical clinic unless you have first obtained an appointment.
- If your condition allows you to do so, call 1-877-644-4545 to be referred to the right resource.
- Visit the emergency room only if you have difficulty breathing (you have difficulty breathing when resting or are unable to breathe when lying down).

**If you do not have any of these symptoms** and you have a health problem, you can consult a health professional, even during the pandemic. **It is especially important to continue your medical follow-up** if you have a chronic disease, heart disease, cancer or any other disease or condition that requires regular health follow-up.

## Quebec: For citizens returning from travelling

Anyone returning from a stay outside Canada, including cruise passengers, must self-isolate for 14 days. Postpone all non-urgent medical appointments.

Such isolation covers both travellers who are sick or display symptoms and those who do not have symptoms and are in perfect health. All individuals who are returning from outside Canada and are in self-isolation at home must abide by the [instructions on returning home from abroad](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/instructions-for-travellers-covid19/#c58168).

Anyone who does not comply with these instructions commits an offence under the federal legislation and is liable to [penalties](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html#a2).

To remind people who are returning to the country of these obligations, police checkpoints will be established near the US border.

It should be noted that businesses that deliver goods from abroad in Québec do not have to ask their employees to temporarily self-isolate.
