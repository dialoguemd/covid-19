## Québec: COVID-19 Online Evaluation Questionnaire and Self-Care Guide - COVID-19

Quebec has developed a preliminary coronavirus [COVID-19 Online Evaluation Questionnaire](https://covid19.quebec.ca/evaluation/).

You must complete the questionnaire, indicating your personal information, including your address and your Health Insurance Card number. This information will allow us to carry out a personalized follow-up of your situation. It is necessary to fill out a form for each person.

You must have an email address and a Quebec Health Insurance Card to use this service. Otherwise, call 1-877-644-4545.

The [Self-Care Guide](https://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/en/document-002492/) is designed to help each individual make the best possible decisions regarding their own health and that of their families during the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it sets down the best means for protection against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and provides information about self-care, basic care for family members, and information about when and where to consult a doctor, if medical care is required.

## Quebec: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you are worried about COVID‑19 or display symptoms such as a cough or fever or sudden loss of sense of smell and taste without nasal congestion, you can call 418-644-4545, 514-644-4545, 450-644-4545, 819-644-4545 and 1-877-644-4545 (toll free) elsewhere in Québec.

If you have symptoms such as a cough or fever or sudden loss of sense of smell and taste without nasal congestion:

- Do not go to a medical clinic unless you have first obtained an appointment.
- If your condition allows you to do so, call 1-877-644-4545. If you are a traveller who has returned within less than 14 days, mention it.
- Visit the emergency room only if you have difficulty breathing (you have difficulty breathing when resting or are unable to breathe when lying down).

In addition, a walk-in screening clinic at the [CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal].(https://santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public/coronavirus-covid-19/) is opening to increase the number of screening tests.

## For citizens returning from travelling

Anyone returning from a stay outside Canada must self-isolate for 14 days. Such isolation covers both travellers who are sick or display symptoms and those who do not have symptoms and are in perfect health. Such individuals must not at any time go outside, even for a walk.

To remind people who are returning to the country of these obligations, police checkpoints will be established near the US border.

It should be noted that businesses that deliver goods from abroad in Québec do not have to ask their employees to temporarily self-isolate.

Individuals who are returning from outside Canada and are in self-isolation at home must abide by the advice indicated [here](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/instructions-directives/).
