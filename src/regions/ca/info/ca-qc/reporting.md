## Québec: COVID-19 Online Evaluation Questionnaire and Self-Care Guide - COVID-19

Anyone, registered or not registered with a family doctor, who has symptoms and who has, or thinks they have, a need for family medicine consultation in order to obtain a clinical evaluation by a nurse and be referred as necessary to the appropriate resource should telephone 1 877 644-4545. As a result, screening and assessment forms are no longer accessible. However, follow-up will be done for all requests being processed. For Service Quebec workers, please refer to your supervisor for more information.

The [Self-Care Guide](https://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/en/document-002492/) is designed to enable Quebecers to make the best possible decisions to protect their health and the health of their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, it indicates to them how best to protect themselves against COVID-19, take care of themselves and provide basic care to their family circle, and know where and when to consult if the need arises for care services.

## Quebec: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you are worried about COVID‑19, you can call 418-644-4545, 514-644-4545, 450-644-4545, 819-644-4545 and 1-877-644-4545 (toll free) elsewhere in Québec.

If you have symptoms such as a cough, fever, difficulty breathing or sudden loss of sense of smell without nasal congestion with or without loss of taste:

- Do not go to a medical clinic unless you have first obtained an appointment.
- If your condition allows you to do so, call 1-877-644-4545. If you are a traveller who has returned within less than 14 days, mention it.
- Visit the emergency room only if you have difficulty breathing (you have difficulty breathing when resting or are unable to breathe when lying down).

In addition, a walk-in screening clinic at the [CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal].(https://santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public/coronavirus-covid-19/) is opening to increase the number of screening tests.

- Do not go to school, to work, to a childcare centre or a day care centre or to any other public space.
- Do not go out for a walk or to walk the dog.
- Do not use public transport.
- Postpone all non-urgent medical appointments.
- Do not receive visitors at home.

Such isolation covers both travellers who are sick or display symptoms and those who do not have symptoms and are in perfect health. All individuals who are returning from outside Canada and are in self-isolation at home must abide by the advice indicated [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/instructions-for-travellers-covid19/&sa=D&ust=1586888257837000&usg=AFQjCNH0Z7HB90yLU7kWQV8Ydk_uj3JTGg).
