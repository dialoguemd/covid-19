The [Self-Care Guide](https://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/en/document-002492/) is designed to help each individual make the best possible decisions regarding their own health and that of their families during the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it sets down the best means for protection against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and provides information about self-care, basic care for family members, and information about when and where to consult a doctor, if medical care is required.

If you have these symptoms:

- Do not go to a medical clinic unless you have first obtained an appointment.
- If your condition allows you to do so, call 1-877-644-4545 to be referred to the right resource.
- Visit the emergency room only if you have difficulty breathing (you have difficulty breathing when resting or are unable to breathe when lying down).

**If you do not have any of these symptoms** and you have a health problem, you can consult a health professional, even during the pandemic. **It is especially important to continue your medical follow-up** if you have a chronic disease, heart disease, cancer or any other disease or condition that requires regular health follow-up.

You have not had a fever for at least 48 hours (without having taken fever medication).

## Quebec: For citizens returning from travelling

Anyone returning from a stay outside Canada, including cruise passengers, must self-isolate for 14 days. Postpone all non-urgent medical appointments.

Such isolation covers both travellers who are sick or display symptoms and those who do not have symptoms and are in perfect health. All individuals who are returning from outside Canada and are in self-isolation at home must abide by the [instructions on returning home from abroad](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/instructions-for-travellers-covid19/#c58168).

Anyone who does not comply with these instructions commits an offence under the federal legislation and is liable to [penalties](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html#a2).

To remind people who are returning to the country of these obligations, police checkpoints will be established near the US border.

It should be noted that businesses that deliver goods from abroad in Québec do not have to ask their employees to temporarily self-isolate.
