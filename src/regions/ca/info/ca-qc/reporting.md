## Quebec: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

### For citizens returning from travel:

[Self-isolation](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/interim-guidance-cases-contacts.html#si) for 14 days is recommended for anyone returning from abroad as of March 12, 2020. Returning travellers must be vigilant and monitor themselves for symptoms.

[Self-isolation](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/interim-guidance-cases-contacts.html#si) is mandatory for all public service employees and health care, education and daycare workers, both private and public, returning from abroad. Public sector employees will continue their treatment during the isolation period.

Residents of Quebec who develop symptoms of fever, cough or difficulty breathing when they return from travelling abroad must contact the toll-free line 1 877 644-4545.

### For citizens who do not return from a trip but who show symptoms:

According to the [Quebec government](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/), people returning from travel can choose to self-isolate. Self-isolation after returning from travel is mandatory for all public service employees and health care, education and daycare workers, both private and public, returning from abroad. Public sector employees will continue their treatment during the isolation period.

People who are uncertain about their health can contact the toll-free line 1 877 644-4545 first. A nurse will assess the situation and provide appropriate recommendations.

## Measures taken by the Government

Several measures have been taken by the government to limit the spread, including:

- the adoption, on March 13, 2020, of a decree declaring a state of health emergency throughout Quebec. This exceptional measure allows, for example, the Minister of Health and Social Services and institutions to proceed without delay with the purchase of equipment or to enter into the necessary contracts to protect the health of the population;
- the 14-day voluntary isolation of all persons returning from abroad on March 12, 2020, or at a later date;
- compulsory isolation of 14 days for all public service employees and for all health, education and childcare personnel, both private and public, returning from abroad on 12 March 2020 or later;
- a ban on all indoor gatherings of more than 250 people;
- encouragement to avoid all unnecessary internal gatherings;
- the closure of all childcare services (CPEs, subsidized, non-subsidized, home-based and non-regulated childcare services) and the education system (primary and secondary schools, training centres, private schools, CEGEPs, colleges and universities) from Monday, March 16 to Friday, March 27. However, measures will be put in place to continue to offer childcare services to parents who work in the health and social services network and in essential services (e.g., police officers, firefighters, ambulance attendants, correctional services officers, special constables);
- prohibiting regular visits to hospitals, CHSLDs and private homes for the elderly throughout Québec;
- coverage, by the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ), of health services related to COVID-19 provided by correspondence or telecommunications;
- prevention and control in the health care setting when an infection is suspected or confirmed;
- the opening of designated clinics to care for people with symptoms;
- the postponement of the municipal by-elections of March 15, 2020, and the 20 others scheduled by the end of April.
