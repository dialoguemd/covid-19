## Québec: Self-Care Guide - COVID-19

The [Self-Care Guide](https://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/en/document-002492/) is designed to help each individual make the best possible decisions regarding their own health and that of their families during the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it sets down the best means for protection against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and provides information about self-care, basic care for family members, and information about when and where to consult a doctor, if medical care is required.

## Quebec: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you are worried about COVID‑19 or have symptoms such as a cough or fever:

- Do not go to a medical clinic unless you have first obtained an appointment.
- Visit the emergency room only if you have difficulty breathing (difficulty breathing at rest or unable to breathe while lying down).
- Before you go to the emergency room, you can call toll free 1-877-644-4545, or 418-644-4545 in the Québec City region, 514-644-4545 in the Montréal area, 450-644-4545 in the Montérégie region, 819-644-4545 in the Outaouais region and 1-877-644-4545 elsewhere in Québec. If your condition allows you to do so and indicate that you are a traveller who has been back for less than 14 days. You will be told how to go there and what precautions to take (wearing a mask, using personal transportation or an ambulance, and so on).

Also, a [walk-in screening clinic](https://ciusss-centresudmtl.gouv.qc.ca/actualite/covid-19-ouverture-dune-clinique-de-depistage-sans-rendez-vous-pour-augmenter-le-nombre-de-depistages) at the CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal openws to increase the number of screening tests.
