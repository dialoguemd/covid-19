## Québec: Self-Care Guide - COVID-19

The [Self-Care Guide](https://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/en/document-002492/) is designed to help each individual make the best possible decisions regarding their own health and that of their families during the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it sets down the best means for protection against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and provides information about self-care, basic care for family members, and information about when and where to consult a doctor, if medical care is required.

## Quebec: What should I do id I'm just back from travelling abroad?

- You are in self-isolation because you returned from travelling abroad on or after March 12, 2020.

OR

- You are under mandatory self-isolation because you are a public sector employee or a public or private health care, education and daycare worker returning from abroad on or after March 12, 2020.

Following these instructions and self-isolating for 14 days after returning from travelling abroad can make all the difference to slow transmission of COVID-19. These instructions are unusual and restrictive, especially if you have young children or are a caregiver.

However, by following these instructions, people around you can avoid getting COVID-19, if ever you are carrying the virus and develop symptoms.
