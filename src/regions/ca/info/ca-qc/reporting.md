## Québec: COVID-19 Online Evaluation Questionnaire and Self-Care Guide - COVID-19

Anyone, registered or not registered with a family doctor, who has symptoms and who has, or thinks they have, a need for family medicine consultation in order to obtain a clinical evaluation by a nurse and be referred as necessary to the appropriate resource should telephone 1 877 644-4545. As a result, screening and assessment forms are no longer accessible. However, follow-up will be done for all requests being processed. For Service Quebec workers, please refer to your supervisor for more information.

The [Self-Care Guide](https://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/en/document-002492/) is designed to help each individual make the best possible decisions regarding their own health and that of their families during the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it sets down the best means for protection against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and provides information about self-care, basic care for family members, and information about when and where to consult a doctor, if medical care is required.

## Quebec: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you are worried about COVID‑19 or if you have [flu-like symptoms](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/flu-cold-and-gastroenteritis/flu-influenza/#c1285) or [gastroenteritis symptoms](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/flu-cold-and-gastroenteritis/gastroenteritis/#c1816) or similar to [COVID‑19](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/general-information-about-coronavirus/#c46539), you can call 418-644-4545, 514-644-4545, 450-644-4545, 819-644-4545 and 1-877-644-4545 (toll free) elsewhere in Québec. For the hearing impaired (TTY), call 1-800-361 9596 (toll free).

If you have these symptoms:

**Testing and evaluation**

In Québec, most cases of COVID-19 are now linked to community transmission. For this reason, a new approach for testing is in place.

**Montréal :**

- Since Monday, April 20 at 8 a.m., services offered at the designated testing clinic at Place des festivals (Quartier des spectacles) are located in the Hôtel-Dieu Hospital’s former emergency department.
- Implementation of [mobile testing clinics](https://santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public/coronavirus-covid-19/#c37517).
- If you have symptoms of flu, gastroenteritis or COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing), you must call 514-644-4545 or 1-877-644-4545 to get an assessment and be referred to the right place.

People prioritized for testing:

- Symptomatic individuals from all communities (including services and sectors that are reopening: schools, daycares, manufacturing, mines, construction, etc.)
- First responders and public safety workers (e.g. police officers and firefighters, correctional officers), as well as other symptomatic workers providing critical/essential services.
- Close contacts of symptomatic or asymptomatic cases, in accordance with the Director of Public Health’s directives. Testing in specific settings, based on reopenings (schools, work places, etc.).

## For citizens returning from travelling

Anyone returning from a stay outside Canada, including cruise passengers, must self-isolate for 14 days. Such individuals must not at any time go outside:

Postpone all non-urgent medical appointments.

Such isolation covers both travellers who are sick or display symptoms and those who do not have symptoms and are in perfect health. All individuals who are returning from outside Canada and are in self-isolation at home must abide by the advice indicated [here](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/instructions-for-travellers-covid19/msg/3/#c34503).

Anyone who does not comply with these instructions commits an offence under the federal legislation and is liable to [penalties](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html#a2).

To remind people who are returning to the country of these obligations, police checkpoints will be established near the US border.

It should be noted that businesses that deliver goods from abroad in Québec do not have to ask their employees to temporarily self-isolate.
