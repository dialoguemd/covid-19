## Québec: Self-Care Guide - COVID-19

The [Self-Care Guide](https://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/en/document-002492/) is designed to help each individual make the best possible decisions regarding their own health and that of their families during the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it sets down the best means for protection against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and provides information about self-care, basic care for family members, and information about when and where to consult a doctor, if medical care is required.


## Quebec: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you are worried about COVID‑19 or have symptoms such as a cough or fever:

- Do not go to a medical clinic unless you have first obtained an appointment.
- Visit the emergency room only if you have difficulty breathing (difficulty breathing at rest or unable to breathe while lying down).
- Before you go to the emergency room, you can call toll free 1-877-644-4545, or 418-644-4545 in the Québec City region, 514-644-4545 in the Montréal area, 450-644-4545 in the Montérégie region, 819-644-4545 in the Outaouais region and 1-877-644-4545 elsewhere in Québec. If your condition allows you to do so and indicate that you are a traveller who has been back for less than 14 days. You will be told how to go there and what precautions to take (wearing a mask, using personal transportation or an ambulance, and so on).

### For citizens returning from travel:

[Self-isolation](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/interim-guidance-cases-contacts.html#si) for 14 days is recommended for anyone returning from abroad on or after March 12, 2020. Returning travellers must be vigilant and monitor themselves for symptoms.

Businesses that deliver goods from abroad in Québec do not have to ask their employees to temporarily self-isolate.

[Self-isolation](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/interim-guidance-cases-contacts.html#si) is mandatory for all public service employees and health care, education and daycare workers, both private and public, returning from abroad. Public sector employees will continue their treatment during the isolation period.

Individuals who are returning from outside Canada and are in self-isolation at home must abide by the advice indicated below.

#### Stay at home

- Do not go to school, to work, to a childcare centre or a day care centre or to any other public space.
- Do not use public transport.
- Postpone all non-urgent medical appointments.
- Do not receive visitors at home.

### If you are living with other people who have not travelled:

- If you do not have a cough or fever, no other specific measure needs to be adopted. Wash your hands frequently and avoid sharing personal items such as towels, utensils and glasses.
- If you have a cough or fever, contact 1-877-644-4545 and until you receive advice:
  - do not receive visitors in the home;
  - remain alone in one room of the house as often as possible and close the door;
  - eat and sleep alone in one room of the house;
  - if possible use a bathroom reserved for your sole use. Otherwise, disinfect it after each use;
  - avoid as much as possible contact with other people in the home. If this is impossible, wear a mask.If a mask is not available, stay at least 2 metres (the length of a big dining table) away from other people;
  - use disposable tissues to cough, blow your nose or sneeze;
  - discard the tissues in the garbage and wash your hands with soap and water;
  - if you do not have disposable tissues, cough or sneeze in the crook of your arm.
