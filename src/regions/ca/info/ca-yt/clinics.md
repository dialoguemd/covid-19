## Yukon: Online self-assessment tool

Use this [self-assessment tool](https://service.yukon.ca/en/covid-19-self-assessment/) to help determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19. You can complete this assessment for yourself or on behalf of someone else, if they are not able.

Yukonâ€™s testing strategy was expanded effective Wednesday, July 15, 2020 to find new cases and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

For all persons, if you have or have not travelled but have any the following symptoms, no matter how mild:

- fever/chills, cough, shortness of breath, runny nose, sore throat, loss of sense of taste or smell, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea or muscle aches.

To protect yourself while out in public, wash your hands frequently or use hand sanitizer if handwashing facilities are not available and maintain a distance of 2 metres from others.
