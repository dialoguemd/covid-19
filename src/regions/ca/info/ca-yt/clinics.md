## Yukon: Online self-assessment tool 

Use this [self-assessment tool](https://service.yukon.ca/en/covid-19-self-assessment/) to help determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19. You can complete this assessment for yourself or on behalf of someone else, if they are not able.

Testing is currently focused on individuals who have traveled outside Yukon or had contact with someone diagnosed as having COVID-19, or have developed symptoms of COVID-19.
