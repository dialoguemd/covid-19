## Yukon: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Someone should be tested for COVID-19 if:

- If theyâ€™ve travelled OR have had close contact with a person with a recent travel history who was or is now symptomatic OR are a known close contact to a confirmed case of COVID-19 and you have any symptoms such as cough, fever/chills, sore throat, headache, runny nose or nasal congestion, vomitting, diarrhea, fatigue or muscle aches or difficulty breathing

OR

- If they have not travelled outside of Yukon but have symptoms such as cough, fever and/or chills, or difficulty breathing

In either case, call 811 before visiting a testing site.

**How can people in communities get tested?**
In communities: Call your local health centre to arrange for testing. [Find a community health centre](https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/hospitals-and-health-centres/find-hospital-or-health-centre).

In Whitehorse: Call 811 or your family physician. They may refer you to the [Respiratory Assessment Centre](https://yukon.ca/en/find-respiratory-assessment-centre) if needed. Only people who meet the screening criteria for COVID-19 will be tested.
