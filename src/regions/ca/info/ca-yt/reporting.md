## Yukon: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Someone should be tested for COVID-19 if:

·They are experiencing symptoms such as coughing, fever, sore throat, or difficulty breathing and have travelled outside Yukon within 14 days of their symptoms starting.

OR

·They are experiencing symptoms such as coughing, fever, sore throat, or difficulty breathing and have been exposed to someone who has been confirmed as having COVID-19.

In either case, call 811 before visiting a testing site.

**How can people in communities get tested?**
In communities: Call your local health centre to arrange for testing. [Find a community health centre](https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/hospitals-and-health-centres/find-hospital-or-health-centre).
