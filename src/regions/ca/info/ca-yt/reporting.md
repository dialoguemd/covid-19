## Yukon: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

ALL travellers coming into Yukon from any other location on or after March 22 and ALL international travellers who returned to Yukon from outside Canada on or after March 13 , are required to self-isolate immediately, for 14 days, and monitor for symptoms.

If you have symptoms:

- Anyone who has symptoms, including cough, fever or difficulty breathing, must also self-isolate.
- Do not go to an emergency department, family doctor, walk-in clinic or your local health centre without calling 811 first.
- If you need immediate medical attention, call 911 and advise them that you may have COVID-19.

To protect yourself while out in public, wash your hands frequently, and maintain a distance of about 2 metres from others.

If you have no symptoms or exposure concerns, but have questions about COVID-19 or novel coronavirus, visit this [website](https://yukon.ca/covid-19).
