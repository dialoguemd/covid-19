The COVID-19 Assessment Centre is an out-of-hospital clinic where people will be assessed by a health-care provider and tested for COVID-19 if required.

You should come to the Assessment Centre, not the Emergency Department, if:

- You have a new or worsening cough and/or fever, and
- In the past 14 days have either travelled outside of Canada or been in contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19.

Patients who meet the criteria above will be tested for COVID-19, which involves taking a sample from the throat or nose with a swab.
