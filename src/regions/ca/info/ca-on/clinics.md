## Ontario: COVID-19 Self-Assessment

Take this [self-assessment](https://covid-19.ontario.ca/self-assessment/) if you think you were exposed to COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) or have symptoms. Youâ€™ll get information on what to do next.
You can also take it on behalf of someone else.

The self-assessment is only meant as an aid and cannot diagnose you. If you have medical questions, consult a health practitioner or [your local public health unit](http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/phu/locations.aspx).
