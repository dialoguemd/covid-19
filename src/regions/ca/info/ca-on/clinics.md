## Ontario: COVID-19 Self-Assessment

Take this [self-assessment](https://covid-19.ontario.ca/self-assessment/) if you think you were exposed to COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) or have symptoms. Youâ€™ll get information on what to do next.
You can also take it on behalf of someone else.

This information is not intended to provide medical advice. If you have medical questions, consult a health practitioner or [your local public health unit](http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/phu/locations.aspx).
If the self-assessment tool does not indicate that you should contact Telehealth or/and if your health issue is not linked to COVID-19, walk-in clinics can still assist. However, please call the clinic before coming down.
