## Ontario: COVID-19 Self-Assessment

If you think you have coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who has it, use this [self-assessment](https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-self-assessment) to help determine how to seek further care.

If you took the assessment before March 27th, please take it again. Updates include more specific instructions for people who have returned to Canada in the past month or have higher risks associated with getting COVID-19.
