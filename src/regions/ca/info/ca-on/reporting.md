## Ontario: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you start to feel symptoms of COVID-19

- Anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough or difficulty breathing) should return home and self-isolate immediately.
- People who are self-isolating should seek clinical assessment over the phone - either by calling their primary care provider's office or Telehealth Ontario 1-866-797-0000. If you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or
  Telehealth Ontario will direct you to in-person care options.

If you need immediate medical attention you should call 911 and mention your travel history and symptoms.

Please do not visit an assessment centre unless you have been referred by a health care professional.

Do not call 911 unless it is an emergency.

Anyone who has travelled outside of Canada should:

- self-isolate for 14 days when they return. People who are self-isolating should not go to work
- monitor themselves for symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus for 14 days after returning to Canada
- contact their primary care provider or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 if they experience symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus
