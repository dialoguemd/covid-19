## Ontario: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

- Anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough or difficulty breathing) should return home and self-isolate immediately.
- People who are self-isolating should seek clinical assessment over the phone - either by calling their primary care provider's office or Telehealth Ontario 1-866-797-0000. If you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or Telehealth Ontario will direct you to in-person care options.

If you need immediate medical attention you should call 911 and mention your travel history and symptoms.

Anyone who has travelled outside of Canada should:

- self-isolate for 14 days when they return. People who are self-isolating should not go to work
- monitor themselves for symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus for 14 days after returning to Canada
- contact their primary care provider or Telehealth Ontario at  1-866-797-0000 if they experience symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus
