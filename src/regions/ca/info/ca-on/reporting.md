## Ontario: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

### Returning from travel

Anyone who has travelled outside of Canada should:

- self-isolate for 14 days when they return. People who are self-isolating should not go to work
  monitor themselves for symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus for 14 days after returning to Canada
  contact Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 or their local public health unit if they experience symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus

In addition:

Workers who have travelled and are part of workplaces that are essential to daily living are able to return to work as long as they do not have symptoms. However, they should self-monitor for a period of 14 days and identify themselves to their employer so that a plan can be put into place to ensure the protection of those workplaces.

Children under the age of 16 years who have travelled outside of Canada should also self-isolate for a period of 14 days. Parents should actively monitor their children's symptoms. Children who are self-isolating should stay at home and avoid social gathering points such as community centres or parks.

### Should I consult in person?

Contact Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 or your [local public health unit](http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/phu/locations.aspx) if youâ€™re experiencing symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus.

Please do not visit an assessment centre unless you have been referred by a healthcare professional.

Do not call 911 unless it is an emergency.
