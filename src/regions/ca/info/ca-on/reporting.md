## Ontario: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Symptoms of COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus, range from mild — like the flu and other common respiratory infections — to severe.

The most common symptoms include:

- fever
- cough
- difficulty breathing
- muscle aches
- fatigue
- headache
- sore throat
- runny nose

Complications from COVID-19 can include serious conditions, like pneumonia or kidney failure and, in some cases, death.

**If you start to feel symptoms of COVID-19**

If you begin to feel symptoms of COVID-19, you should stay home and self-isolate immediately and take a self-assessment to help determine how to seek further care.

Only call 911 if it is an emergency.

**Returning from travel**

To slow the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in the country, the Government of Canada has put in place an emergency order under the Quarantine Act that applies to all travellers arriving in Canada.

Under this order, if you have recently returned to Canada you must self-isolate (quarantine) and stay home whether you have symptoms or not. Even if you do not have symptoms right away, you are at risk of developing them and infecting others.

If you need it, you will get immediate medical attention when you arrive in Canada.
