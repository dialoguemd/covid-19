## Ontario: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Symptoms of COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus, range from mild — like the flu and other common respiratory infections — to severe.

Call 911 if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms:

- severe difficulty breathing (struggling for each breath, can only speak in single words)
- severe chest pain (constant tightness or crushing sensation)
- feeling confused or unsure of where you are
- losing consciousness

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include:

- fever (feeling hot to the touch, a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius or higher)
- chills
- cough that's new or worsening (continuous, more than usual)
- barking cough, making a whistling noise when breathing (croup)
- shortness of breath (out of breath, unable to breathe deeply)
- sore throat
- difficulty swallowing
- runny, stuffy or congested nose (not related to seasonal allergies or other known causes or conditions)
- lost sense of taste or smell
- pink eye (conjunctivitis)
- headache that’s unusual or long lasting
- digestive issues (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain)
- muscle aches
- extreme tiredness that is unusual (fatigue, lack of energy)
- falling down often
- for young children and infants: sluggishness or lack of appetite

Complications from COVID-19 can include serious conditions, like pneumonia or kidney failure and, in some cases, death.

**If you start to feel symptoms of COVID-19**

If you begin to feel symptoms of COVID-19, you should:

- go to a [COVID-19 assessment centre](https://covid-19.ontario.ca/covid-19-assessment-centres) to get tested
- stay home and self-isolate unless you are going to to the assessment centre
- tell people you were in close physical contact with in the 48 hours before your symptoms began to monitor their health and to self-isolate

Only call 911 if it is an emergency.

As part of its fall preparedness plan, Keeping Ontarians Safe: Preparing for Future Waves of COVID-19, the Ontario government is partnering with pharmacies to expand access to COVID-19 testing to track, trace and isolate cases.

Starting Friday, September 25, 2020, the pharmacy locations below will be offering free testing by appointment only to individuals with no symptoms of COVID-19. More pharmacy locations will make testing available in the coming weeks.

Individuals must follow all public health measures when going for a test, including wearing a mask, practising physical distancing, and frequent handwashing. If you are feeling ill on the date of your appointment, please stay home and re-schedule your test.

**Returning from travel**

To slow the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in the country, the Government of Canada has put in place an emergency order under the Quarantine Act that applies to all travellers arriving in Canada.

Under this order, if you have recently returned to Canada you must self-isolate (quarantine) and stay home whether you have symptoms or not. Even if you do not have symptoms right away, you are at risk of developing them and infecting others.

If you need it, you will get immediate medical attention when you arrive in Canada.
