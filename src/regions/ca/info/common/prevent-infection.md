## 👨‍👩‍👧 Reducing your risk of infection or spreading infection to others

### Preventing coronavirus

Canadians should continue to think ahead about the actions that they can take to stay healthy and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Canada. This includes staying at home as much as possible and being prepared in case you or a family member becomes ill. Everyone should be practising physical (social) distancing. Even if you do not have symptoms of COVID-19, you could become infected by others.

As we continue to see transmission of the virus within different communities, we know that everyone must take precautions, even those who have not travelled outside of Canada.

In an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within communities and across the country, all Canadians are advised to:

- Stay at home unless you have to go to work
  - Talk to your employer about working at home if possible
- Avoid all non-essential trips in your community
- Do not gather in groups
- Limit contact with people at higher risk, such as older adults and those in poor health
- Go outside to exercise but stay close to home
- If you leave your home, always keep a distance of at least 2 arms lengths (approximately 2 metres) from others

  - household contacts (people you live with) do not need to distance from each other unless they are sick or have travelled in the last 14 days

You can go for a walk if you:

- Have not been diagnosed with COVID-19
- Do not have symptoms of COVID-19
- Have not travelled outside of Canada in the past 14 days
- Are not in quarantine (self-isolating)
- Are not isolating

If you go out for a walk, do not congregate and always practise physical (social) distancing by keeping at least 2 metres apart from others at all times.

### Travellers

The risk for getting COVID-19 may be increased for travellers. Canadians are advised to [avoid all non-essential travel](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/221). If you must travel, check the [latest travel advice](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html) before you leave.

Health Canada will continue to adapt their risk assessment based on the latest data available.

### If you or your child become ill

If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:

- Isolate yourself at home for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others
  - If you live with others, stay in a separate room or keep a 2-metre distance
- Visit a health care professional or call your local public health authority
  - Call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions

Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.

If you become sick while travelling back to Canada:

- Inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer
- Advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms
  - This is required under the Quarantine Act
  - The Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow

### Physical (social) distancing

Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak.

This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:

- Avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings
- Avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes
- Limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health
- Keeping a distance of at least 2 arms lengths (approximately 2 metres) from others

### Hygiene

Proper hygiene can help reduce the risk of infection or spreading infection to others:

- Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the washroom and when preparing food
  - Use alcohol-based [hand sanitizer](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/hand-sanitizer.html) if soap and water are not available
- When coughing or sneezing:
  - Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand
  - Dispose of any tissues you have used as soon as possible in a lined waste basket and wash your hands afterwards
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands

### Cleaning

Coronaviruses are one of the easiest types of viruses to kill with the appropriate disinfectant product when used according to the label directions. Health Canada has published a [list of hard surface disinfectants](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/list.html) that are likely to be effective for use against COVID-19.

Although they do not claim to kill COVID-19, cleaners can play a role in limiting the transfer of microorganisms. Health Canada recommends cleaning high-touch surfaces often, using either regular household cleaners or diluted bleach. This bleach solution should be prepared according to the instructions on the label or in a ratio of 250 mL (1 cup) of water per 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of bleach. Directions are based on bleach that is 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Never mix bleach with other chemical products and use it in a well-ventilated area. [Special precautions](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/home-safety/household-chemical-safety.html) must be used when cleaning with bleach to avoid serious incidents.

These surfaces include:

- Toilets
- Phones
- Electronics
- Door handles
- Bedside tables
- Television remotes

Refer to the [guidance on cleaning and disinfecting public spaces](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/cleaning-disinfecting-public-spaces.html) for more information.

### Wearing masks or face coverings

Medical masks, including surgical, medical procedure face masks and respirators (like N95 masks), must be kept for health care workers and others providing direct care to COVID-19 patients.

Wearing a non-medical mask or face covering while out in public is recommended for periods of time when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, particularly in crowded public settings, such as:

- Stores
- shopping areas
- public transportation

Public health officials will make recommendations based on a number of factors, including the rates of infection and/or transmission in the community. Recommendations may vary from location to location.

If you do choose to wear one, refer to the:

- [guidelines on wearing non-medical masks and how to make your own](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/instructions-sew-no-sew-cloth-face-covering.html)
- [COVID-19 Special Advisory Committee](http://www.phn-rsp.ca/sac-covid-ccs/index-eng.php)'s recommendations on the [use of non-medical cloth masks or face coverings in community settings](http://www.phn-rsp.ca/sac-covid-ccs/wearing-masks-community-eng.php)

Masks alone will not prevent the spread of COVID-19. You must consistently and strictly adhere to good hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and physical (social) distancing.
