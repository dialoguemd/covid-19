## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß Reducing your risk of infection or spreading infection to others

### Preventing coronavirus

Canadians should continue to think ahead about the actions that they can take to stay healthy and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Canada. Measures to [reduce COVID-19 in your community](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/measures-reduce-community.html) are especially important as some areas begin to lift restrictions.

In an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within communities and across the country, all Canadians are advised to:

- Avoid closed spaces, crowded places, and close contact
- Stay home and away from others if you feel sick
- Stick to a small and consistent social circle and avoid gathering in large groups
- Talk to your employer about working at home if possible
- Limit contact with [people at higher risk](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/people-high-risk-for-severe-illness-covid-19.html), such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems
- Go outside to exercise
- Keep a distance of at least 2 arms lengths (approximately 2 metres) from others

  - household contacts (people you live with) don‚Äôt need to distance from each other unless they‚Äôre sick or have travelled in the last 14 days

### Travellers

The risk for getting COVID-19 may be increased for travellers. If you must travel, check the [latest travel advice](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html) before you leave.

If you‚Äôre a returning traveller (either travelling into Canada, or, in some instances, travelling from one province or territory to another) you‚Äôll be required to:

- [Quarantine (self-isolate)](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-home-exposed-no-symptoms.html) at home when you may have been exposed to COVID-19 and have no symptoms
- [Isolate](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/covid-19-how-to-isolate-at-home.html) yourself if you have [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms.html#s) and it‚Äôs possible that you‚Äôve been exposed to the virus

Health Canada will continue to adapt their risk assessment based on the latest data available.

[Additional restrictions apply to travellers returning to Canada.](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html#f)

### If you or your child become ill

If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:

- Isolate yourself at home for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others
  - If you live with others, stay in a separate room or keep a 2-metre distance
- Visit a health care professional or call your [local public health authority](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html) for information on getting [tested](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/testing.html)
  - Call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions

Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the [advice for caregivers](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/how-to-care-for-child-with-covid-19-at-home-advice-for-caregivers.html). This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.

If you become sick while travelling back to Canada:

- Inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer
- Advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms
  - This is required under the Quarantine Act
  - The Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow

### Physical distancing

Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. [Physical distancing](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/social-distancing.html) is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak.

This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:

- Avoiding crowded places and non-essential travel
- Avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes
- Limiting contact with people at higher risk, such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems
- Keeping a distance of at least 2 arms lengths (approximately 2 metres) from others

### Hygiene

Maintaining good hand and respiratory hygiene are very important personal practices that help reduce the risk of infection or spreading infection to others.

- Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
  - If soap and water aren‚Äôt available, use a [hand sanitizer](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/hand-sanitizer.html) containing at least 60% alcohol.
- When coughing or sneezing:
  - Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand
  - Dispose of any tissues you have used as soon as possible in a lined waste basket and wash your hands afterwards
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands

### Cleaning

The COVID-19 virus is most likely to be on surfaces you frequently touch with your hands. [Clean and disinfect](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/cleaning-disinfecting.html) high-touch surfaces to lower the chance of COVID-19 spreading in your home, workplace and public spaces.

Health Canada has published a [list of hard surface disinfectants](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/list.html) that are likely to be effective for use against COVID-19.

[Special precautions](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/home-safety/household-chemical-safety.html) must be used when cleaning with bleach to avoid serious incidents.

### Wearing masks or face coverings

Wearing a non-medical mask or face covering while out in public is **recommended** for periods of time when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, particularly in crowded public settings, such as:

- Shopping areas
- Public transportation
- Stores and personal service settings

In some situations, provincial or territorial public health authorities have made it mandatory to wear a non-medical mask (or face covering) in public areas. Public health officials make such recommendations based on a number of factors, including how much COVID-19 is circulating in your community. In some jurisdictions, the use of masks in many indoor public spaces and on public transit is now mandatory. You can check with your local public health authority on the requirements for your location.

Masks alone won‚Äôt prevent the spread of COVID-19. You must consistently and strictly adhere to good hygiene and public health measures, including core personal practices like frequent hand washing and physical distancing.
