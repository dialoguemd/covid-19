## üõ´ Travel Advice

If you must travel, take precautions against respiratory illnesses, and seek medical attention if you become sick.

**During your trip:**

- Avoid spending time in large crowds or crowded areas.
- Avoid contact with sick people, especially if they have fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.
- Be aware of the local situation and follow local public health advice.

**All travellers are reminded to follow these health precautions:**

- Wash your hands:
  - Wash your hands often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds.
  - Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer only if soap and water are not available. It's a good idea to always keep some with you when you travel.
- Practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette:
  - Cover your mouth and nose with your arm to reduce the spread of germs.
  - If you use a tissue, dispose of it as soon as possible and wash your hands afterwards.

**Monitor your health:**

If you become sick when you are travelling, avoid contact with others except to see a health care professional.

If you feel sick during your flight to Canada or upon arrival, inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer.

If you do not have symptoms but believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, report this information to a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada. This is required under the Quarantine Act. The Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow.

We have put messaging on arrivals screens at international airports that will help guide travellers to inform a border services officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms.

In addition, information on what symptoms to identify and how to contact local health authorities will be provided to arriving travellers.

## üö¢ Avoid all travel on cruise ships

The Government of Canada is advising that Canadians **avoid all travel on cruise ships due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, until further notice.**

Cruise passengers include travellers from around the world who may be arriving from areas with known or unknown spread of COVID-19. The virus can spread quickly on board cruises due to the close contact between passengers. Older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are at a higher risk of developing severe disease.

Recent cruise ship outbreaks of COVID-19 indicate that a large number of individuals onboard can become infected. While the majority of affected passengers may experience mild symptoms, there have been a significant number of cases requiring hospitalization and critical care, and some deaths have been reported.
