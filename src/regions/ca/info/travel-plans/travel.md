## üõ´ If you must travel during the pandemic

Take precautions against respiratory illnesses, and seek medical attention if you become sick.

During your trip:

- avoid large crowds or crowded areas
- avoid contact with sick people, especially if they have a cough, fever or difficulty breathing
- be aware of the local situation and follow local public health advice
- wash your hands often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds
- use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available and always keep some with you when you travel
- practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette

## Monitor your health

If you become sick, avoid contact with others except to see a health care professional.

If you feel sick during your flight to Canada or upon arrival, inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer.

If you do not have symptoms but believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, report this information to a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada. This is required under the Quarantine Act. The Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow.

You will see messaging on arrivals screens at international airports to help guide you if you are experiencing flu-like symptoms.

Arriving travellers will also be provided with information on what symptoms to identify and how to contact local health authorities.

## üö¢ Avoid all travel on cruise ships

The Government of Canada is advising that Canadians **avoid all travel on cruise ships due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, until further notice.**

Cruise passengers include travellers from around the world who may be arriving from areas with known or unknown spread of COVID-19. The virus can spread quickly on board cruises due to the close contact between passengers. Older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are at a higher risk of developing severe disease.

Recent cruise ship outbreaks of COVID-19 indicate that a large number of individuals onboard can become infected. While the majority of affected passengers may experience mild symptoms, there have been a significant number of cases requiring hospitalization and critical care, and some deaths have been reported.

As the COVID-19 situation evolves, many countries outside of Canada are implementing policies and restrictions in order to contain the global outbreak. These restrictions may impact a cruise traveller's:

- itinerary
- ability to disembark
- access to health care

While abroad, if an outbreak of COVID-19 occurs on your cruise ship:

- you could be subject to quarantine procedures, onboard ship or in a foreign country
- the range of consular services available to those on cruise ships, in particular in situations of quarantine, may be significantly restricted by local authorities
- upon return to Canada, you will be required to remain in mandatory isolation for 14 days at a location determined by the Chief Public Health Officer as per the terms of any applicable emergency orders

Although it is not advised, Canadians who choose to voyage on a cruise ship should also be aware that they:

- may not be offered the opportunity to return to Canada on a government-organized repatriation flight or
- could be responsible for the costs of repatriation travel
