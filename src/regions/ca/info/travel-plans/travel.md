## üõ´ If you must travel during the pandemic

Take precautions against respiratory illnesses, and seek medical attention if you become sick.

During your trip:

- Avoid large crowds or crowded areas
- Avoid contact with sick people, especially if they have a cough, fever or difficulty breathing
- Be aware of the local situation and follow local public health advice
- Wash your hands often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds
- Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available and always keep some with you when you travel
- Practice proper cough and sneeze etiquette

## Monitor your health

If you become sick, avoid contact with others except to see a health care professional.

If you feel sick during your flight to Canada or upon arrival, inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer.

If you do not have symptoms but believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, report this information to a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada. This is required under the Quarantine Act. The Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow.

You will see messaging on arrivals screens at international airports to help guide you if you are experiencing flu-like symptoms.

Arriving travellers will also be provided with information on what symptoms to identify and how to contact local health authorities.
