## üè† Self-isolation

Early epidemiologic evidence suggests that the majority of people who develop COVID-19 will have mild illness and may not require care in a hospital. It is important that people who do not require hospital-level care convalesce at home as long as effective self-isolation and appropriate monitoring (i.e. for worsening of illness) can be provided.

Individuals should be isolated in the home setting while symptomatic (i.e. not go out unless directed to do so to seek medical care) until symptoms have resolved and the person is feeling well enough to resume normal activities, and has met the clinical and laboratory criteria set by the PHA for discontinuing isolation

The location where a person will be isolated will be determined by their healthcare provider and the PHA. When determining the location, several factors to determine the suitability of the home setting are described [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/interim-guidance-cases-contacts.html#app1).
