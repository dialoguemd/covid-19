## üè† Self-isolation

Epidemiologic evidence suggests that the majority of people who develop COVID-19 have mild illness and may not require care in a hospital. It is important that people who do not require hospital-level care convalesce in a suitable environment where effective isolation and appropriate monitoring (i.e. for worsening of illness) can be provided.

Cases should be isolated in the home setting while symptomatic (i.e. not go out unless directed to do so to seek medical care, do not take public transportation to seek medical care and avoid contact with others). If transferring a case from the community to an acute care facility, notify the receiving facility prior to arrival to ensure appropriate IPC measures are in place.

Home isolation should continue for a minimum of 10 days from the onset of symptoms or as directed by the PHA. The criteria for discontinuing home isolation includes: at least 10 days have passed since onset of first symptom or laboratory confirmation of an asymptomatic case, the case did not require hospitalization, the case is afebrile and has improved clinically. Absence of cough is not required for those known to have chronic cough or for those who are experiencing reactive airways post infection.

The location where a person will be isolated will be determined by their healthcare provider and the PHA. Symptomatic people entering Canada are subject to legal orders for mandatory isolation and are not permitted to isolate in a place where they will have contact with vulnerable people. The Public Health Agency of Canada's Chief Public Health Officer will designate a facility for travellers who do not have an appropriate place to isolate.
