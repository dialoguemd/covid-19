## New Brunswick: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Anyone who has traveled internationally in the last 14 days should self-monitor for two weeks from when they arrived back in Canada. Individual risk will vary depending on the destination.

People arriving from Iran or the Chinese province of Hubei will need to self-isolate regardless of symptoms.

Symptoms such as fever, cough, difficulty breathing may take up to 14 days to appear.

Should an individual who has recently traveled outside the country experience non-specific symptoms (such as headache, congestion, achiness, feeling unwell) they should separate themselves from others and stay home to monitor themselves further.

Should these symptoms progress to include fever or cough, the individual should:

- continue to stay at home
- immediately call Tele-Care 811
- describe symptoms and travel history
- follow instructions carefully

These individuals should pay particular attention to taking everyday precautions as well as generally keeping space between themselves and others, such as minimizing attendance at crowded gatherings and mass events or thinking of other ways of participating (virtual attendance). Protect yourself and others.

They should also think about what health and food supplies they need on hand should they have to stay home, and slowly start replenishing their shelves. Make a plan.
