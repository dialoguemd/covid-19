## New Brunswick: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Use this [self-assessment tool](https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/ocmoh/cdc/content/respiratory_diseases/coronavirus.html) to help determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19. You can complete this assessment for yourself or on behalf of someone else, if they are not able.

If you have symptoms:

- Please do not visit a hospital, physicianâ€™s office, lab or healthcare facility without consulting 811 first.
- If you are having difficulty breathing or experiencing other severe symptoms, call 911 immediately. Advise them of your symptoms and travel history.
