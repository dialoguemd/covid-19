## New Brunswick: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

If you are concerned you have COVID-19, contact Telecare 811.

All travelers returning to NB should monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms for 14 days. Upon your return, monitor your health for fever, cough or difficulty breathing and avoid places where you cannot easily separate yourself from others if you become ill.

Travelers from some destinations will be given advice by the Canadian Border Services Agency and may be asked to stay at home for 14 days regardless of symptoms. Those people will be notified of this when they arrive in Canada.

If you develop a fever, cough or difficulty breathing within those 14 days:

- isolate yourself from others as quickly as possible
- immediately call Telecare 811 before seeking medical attention
- describe your symptoms and travel history
- follow their instructions carefully
- New Brunswick hospitals are prepared to receive patients for diagnosis and treatment of symptoms, and there are protocols in place to ensure a potential case is not spread to other users of the hospital system. By contacting Telecare 811, these practices will be put in place before your arrival and during your time at the hospital.
