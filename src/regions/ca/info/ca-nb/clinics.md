## New Brunswick: Online self-assessment tool

Before calling 811 use this [self-assessment tool](https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/ocmoh/cdc/content/respiratory_diseases/coronavirus.html) to help determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19. You can complete this assessment for yourself or on behalf of someone else, if they are not able. Common symptoms for COVID-19 include: Fever above 38 degrees Celsius, a new cough, or worsening chronic cough, sore throat, runny nose, headache, a new onset of fatigue, a new onset of muscle pain, diarrhea, loss of sense of taste, loss of sense of smell, and, in children, purple markings on the fingers and toes.
