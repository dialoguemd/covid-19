## New Brunswick: Online self-assessment tool

The regional health authorities will be opening community assessment centres to allow those who have been identified as high risk to be tested, without going to an Emergency Department.

Individuals who are experiencing mild to moderate symptoms will be directed to the assessment centres by Tele-Care 811. Once the individual has been assessed by Tele-Care, and if they require an in-person assessment, a referral will be provided to the Community Assessment Centre in their area.

It is important to note that these centres are not walk-in clinics. They are appointment based and all appointments are made through Tele-Care 811.

In an effort to allow 811 health-care professionals to support more people who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, a new [online tool](https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/ocmoh/cdc/content/respiratory_diseases/coronavirus/assessment.html#/app;age=45;units=years;gender=female/symptom-checker/guides/399/what-to-do) to assess symptoms is available. Using this tool will help New Brunswickers determine when they should call the 811 line, which will reduce the volume of calls we have seen from people seeking basic information.
