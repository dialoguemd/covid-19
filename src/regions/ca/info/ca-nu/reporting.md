## Nuvavut: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

As of March 15, 2020 the Chief Public Health Officer of Nunavut is advising travellers arriving in Nunavut from any destination to self-isolate for 14 days after your return.

If you develop symptoms and have travelled to a region with known cases of COVID-19
occurring in the community or have been in contact with someone who has:

- stay at home and avoid contact with others
- follow up with your health care professional

If you develop fever, cough or difficulty breathing in the next 14 days, call your health
care provider or local public health authority and advise them of possible contact with
COVID-19.

If you are ill and must visit a health care professional, call ahead or tell them when you
arrive that you have a respiratory illness and if you have traveled.
