## Manitoba: Specialized COVID-19 Clinics

If you've been exposed to COVID-19 but don't have symptoms, don't go to a health-care facility unless absolutely necessary. If you do have to go, call Health Links - Info Sant√© at 204-788-8200 or toll-free 1-888-315-9257. Don't show up without calling ahead first so the centre can get ready for your arrival.

Testing in Manitoba is being done only for patients showing symptoms. Tests are being offered to those people at Access Winnipeg West (280 Booth Dr.) and Access Fort Garry (135 Plaza Dr.)

The two centres are open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and on weekends from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Outside of those hours, you'll have to go an urgent care centre or an emergency room.

More sites are expected to start offering the test later this week, with plans for more to come throughout Manitoba.
