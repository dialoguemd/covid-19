## Newfoundland and Labrador: Self-assessment tool

The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has developped [this](https://www.811healthline.ca/covid-19-self-assessment/) self-assessment tool to help determine whether you should get tested for COVID-19.

You can complete this assessment for yourself or on behalf of someone else, if they are not able.

If you have returned from travel outside Newfoundland and Labrador in the past 14 days, you need to self-isolate for 14 days.

To protect yourself while out in public, wash your hands frequently, and maintain a distance of about 2 metres from others.
