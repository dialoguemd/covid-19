## Newfoundland and Labrador: Self-assessment tool

The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has developped [this self-assessment tool](https://www.811healthline.ca/covid-19-self-assessment/) to help determine whether you should get tested for COVID-19.

You can complete this assessment for yourself or on behalf of someone else, if they are not able.

If you have questions about COVID-19, please visit the following site:

- [Learn about COVID-19 and actions being taken to protect the health of Newfoundlanders and Labradordorians](https://www.gov.nl.ca/covid-19/).

If you have returned from travel outside Newfoundland and Labrador in the past 14 days, you need to self-isolate for 14 days.

To protect yourself while out in public, wash your hands frequently, and maintain a distance of about 2 metres from others.
