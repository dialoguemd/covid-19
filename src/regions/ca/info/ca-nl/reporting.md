## Newfoundland and Labrador: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Individuals who have travelled outside of the country or attended a mass gathering event with international attendees in the 14 days prior to their return to Newfoundland and Labrador are asked to closely monitor their health and contact 811 if you develop fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.

Anyone who has been to the Hubei province of China, Iran, or Italy, or has been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 or someone that is ill and has travelled to these areas, are asked to self-isolate (away from work and school) for 14 days from their last day in the region or their last contact with the affected person. They are asked to monitor themselves and their household contacts closely. Those in self-isolation should contact 811 to receive supporting health information from Newfoundland and Labrador Public Health.

These timelines apply to those newly arrived in the province and those who have already returned. Anyone who meets either of the above criteria who develops a fever, cough or difficulty breathing should call 811 to receive further information.
