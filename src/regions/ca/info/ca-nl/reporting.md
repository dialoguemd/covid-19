## Newfoundland and Labrador: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or aches and pains.

Note that an individual with COVID-19 may not have all of these symptoms. The severity of symptoms can range from mild to severe.

Current information suggests that most cases are not severe nor do they require hospitalization.

If you start to have symptoms of COVID-19:

- Do not visit your family physicianâ€™s office and, unless it is a medical emergency, please do not go to your Emergency Department. You should stay at home and complete the 811 self-assessment tool to determine if you require COVID-19 testing. If you cannot access the self-assessment tool, please call 811.
- If you are self-isolating, you will need to continue self-isolation until Public Health advises otherwise.
- If you were not self-isolating, you will be put in self-isolation and COVID-19 testing will be arranged through Public Health.

For anyone having issues or concerns regarding self-isolation, please call the Canadian Red Cross COVID-19 help line at 1-800-863-6582, available 8:00am to 8:00pm daily.
