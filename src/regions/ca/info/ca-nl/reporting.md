## Newfoundland and Labrador: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

Anyone arriving from outside of Canada is asked to self-isolate and monitor for symptoms. You may also be asked to self-isolate if you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19.

Newfoundlanders and Labradorians arriving from outside of Canada are asked to self-isolate, meaning stay home and do not got to work or school, and monitor for symptoms for 14 days after arrival in Canada.

If you are not having symptoms, you should:

Stay at home and do not go to work or school for 14 days.
Avoid close contact with people with chronic conditions, compromised immune systems and older adults.
You do not need COVID-19 testing if you do not have symptoms.
Monitor for symptoms (symptoms include: fever or coughing or difficulty breathing).
If you start to have symptoms, you should isolate yourself from others as quickly as possible and contact 811 for further direction.
