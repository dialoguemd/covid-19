## Should I stop taking medications that suppress my immune system?

Stopping active treatments can have serious and immediate negative effects on your health. Despite what you may have heard, at present there are no medications for which a definite recommendation to stop has been made. Some medications like Ibuprofen are being studied, but there is no clear evidence that it can worsen illness.

Your pharmacist and doctor are excellent sources of information on recommendations for medicines you can use. It is strongly suggested to ask your pharmacist for instructions before taking over-the-counter medication when you have symptoms.

For Children there are some medications and treatments to avoid. Do not rub your child with alcohol to lower fever as it may be absorbed by the skin or enter the lungs and can be toxic • Do not give ibuprofen (Advil®, Motrin®, etc.) to children under the age of six months • Do not give acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin®, etc.) to children or teenagers under the age of 18.
