## Should I stop taking medications that suppress my immune system?

First and foremost, if you are on a medication that suppresses your immune system, DO NOT STOP TAKING YOUR MEDICATION. We know that with everything going on, this might be your first reaction, but this is absolutely not an option. Stopping any sort of treatment plan without direct guidance from your healthcare provider is dangerous and could result in hospitalization, which is clearly undesirable for exposure to coronavirus. Please, continue to take your medication and implement extra precautions in your day to day life until the threat has passed.
