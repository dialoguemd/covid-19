## How long does the virus stay active on surfaces?

According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses#), the virus can usually stay on a surface for a few hours, but depending on the type of surface (porosity, humidity, heat) it could be several days.

It is therefore important to [disinfect surfaces](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19.html) that could be contaminated and to [wash your hands properly](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/reduce-spread-covid-19-wash-your-hands.html) after touching them.
