## Should I still go visit my parents in their long-term care facility or hospital?

As of March 13, 2020, non-essential visits to hospitals, intermediate resources, family-type resources and targeted private residences for seniors will be prohibited in order to protect the most vulnerable people and workers in the health and social services network. In the case of births, the other parent, significant person or caregiver identified for this purpose is not considered a visitor and may accompany the person giving birth.
