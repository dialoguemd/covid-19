## Should I still go visit my parents in their long-term care facility or hospital?

It is critical to verify precautions in place with each institution far in advance of arrival to allow you to prepare. Many early outbreaks were introduced by visitors and it important to comply with all rules to prevent further outbreaks in vulnerable sites. Please note that rules or restrictions may change without notice at a particular site. Please verify frequently for these changes.

Based on public health direction or local or regional status of COVID-19 cases it may be necessary to prohibit visitors. A "no visitor" policy should be strongly considered.
If visitors are permitted, they should be strictly limited to those who are essential, meaning necessary to basic personal care (e.g. feeding), medical (e.g. phlebotomy) or compassionate (e.g. end of life) resident care. Essential visitors should be limited to one person at a time for each resident.

Visitors should be screened for signs and symptoms of infection at every visit. If signs and symptoms are present, or if they are on self-isolation or quarantine as per relevant public health directives, they should be excluded from visiting and suggested to follow up with local public health or their healthcare provider.

Visitor movement within the LTCH should be limited to visiting the resident directly and exiting the LTCH directly after their visit.
All visitors should be required to put on a mask at entry to the LTCH, to reduce the risk of transmitting COVID-19 infection to residents or LTCH staff, which may occur even when no symptoms of illness are recognized.
