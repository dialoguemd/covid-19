## If I get sick, in how long am contagious for and/or when am I expected to feel better?

According to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---24-february-2020), recovery time appears to be around two weeks for mild infections and three to six weeks for severe disease.

The time between exposure to COVID-19 and the moment when symptoms start is commonly around five to six days but can range from 1 â€“ 14 days.

If you are recovering from COVID-19, it's important to stay home and "self-isolate" until your doctor or nurse tells you it's safe to go back to your normal activities. Self-isolation means staying apart from other people, even the people you live with. When you can stop self-isolation will depend on how long it has been since you had symptoms, and in some cases, whether you have had a negative test (showing that the virus is no longer in your body).
