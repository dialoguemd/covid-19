## What do I do: I'm told not to leave my house but I'm asked for a medical certificate for my work (which implies that I'll have to leave my house to get it...)?

Refer your employer to government guidelines. They are asking employers to relax sick leave policies to support employees in self-isolating when ill. This includes suspending the need for medical notes to reduce the burden on an already stressed health care system.

It is not recommended to go to hospitals and medical clinics, especially if you are not sick.
If you require an employee to provide a medical certificate, you should be aware that the costs associated with it may be a cost related to your company's operations and payroll taxes.
If you ask an employee to be absent from work during his or her shift to obtain a medical certificate, you must pay for the employee's travel time.
The law stipulates that an employee is deemed to be at work if his or her travel is required by his or her employer.
