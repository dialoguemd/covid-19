## Where can I find reliable information on the coronavirus?

Only official sources should be considered as they have the latest status on covid-19. 

We do not send any Dialogue-produced information about covid-19 as the knowledge around the virus is constantly updated and any non-official source could be outdated at any moment as the governments update their information on a daily basis (and sometimes multiple times per day).
