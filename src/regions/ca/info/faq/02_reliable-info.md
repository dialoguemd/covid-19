## Where can I find reliable information on the coronavirus?

Only official sources should be considered as they have the latest status on COVID-19. Unofficial sources of information can be quickly out of date, unlike government sources, which are updated on a daily basis (or even several times a day).

We do not send any information documents produced by Dialogue about COVID-19, as the situation around the Virus is evolving rapidly, we prefer to direct you to the attached official sources.
