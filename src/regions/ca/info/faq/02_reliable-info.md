## Where can I find reliable information on the coronavirus?

Only official sources should be considered as they have the latest status on COVID-19. Unofficial sources of information, such as social media, can be quickly out of date. It is recommended to always refer to your government website and phone health lines.

We do not send any information documents produced by Dialogue about COVID-19, as the situation around the virus is evolving rapidly, we prefer to direct you to the attached official sources.
