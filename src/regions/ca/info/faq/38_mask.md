## If I go outside, should I wear a mask?

Certain jurisdictions now require masks, for example in public service offices, libraries and more. As Canada plans to reopen it is important to comply with regulations and co-operate with officials, shop and restaurant owners and more, for everyoneâ€™s protection.

**Wearing masks or face coverings**

Wearing a non-medical mask or face covering while out in public is **recommended** for periods of time when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, particularly in crowded public settings, such as:

- Stores
- Shopping areas
- Public transportation

Please read the [Canadian guidelines on wearing non-medical masks and how to make your own](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html).

Masks alone will not prevent the spread of COVID-19. You must consistently and strictly adhere to [good hygiene](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#hygiene) and [public health measures](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#p), including frequent [hand washing](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/reduce-spread-covid-19-wash-your-hands.html) and [physical (social) distancing](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/social-distancing.html).
