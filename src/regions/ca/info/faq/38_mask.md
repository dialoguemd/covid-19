## If I go outside, should I wear a mask?

Wearing a mask, outside of places with special instructions (hospitals, clinics, etc.), is not recommended for healthy people.

Indeed, there are several risks associated with wearing a mask:

- A false sense of security, which reduces your vigilance in not touching multiple surfaces, not washing your hands or avoiding touching your face.
- A risk of contamination when you put on, adjust or remove and discard your mask.

It is important, however, to continue to avoid any gathering, wash your hands well, touch the surfaces with a cloth and keep a distance of 2 meters from other people.

If you have any health problems, whether they are acute respiratory problems (cough, runny nose...), chronic or a condition that diminishes your immune system, or if you are caring for someone who is infected, it is, however, advisable to wear a mask. Wash your hands before placing it, adjust it well as soon as you put it on, change it regularly and remove it by the straps and then wash your hands.
