## What is the difference between a pandemic & epidemic? Why did WHO declare this a pandemic?

An epidemic is a rapid outbreak that affects a large number of patients in a short time in a specific region. A pandemic is an epidemic that spreads at the national or international level. The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic because of its rapid global spread among patients around the world.
