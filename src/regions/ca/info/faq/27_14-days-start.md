## I’ve just come back from vacation. When does the 14 day quarantine begin? If I develop symptoms and need to self-isolate, is it an additional 14 days?

No, it starts 14 days from the day you return to Canada. The 14-day quarantine is to see if you develop symptoms after exposure. If you test positive, it’s up to the treatment team to decide when you can break isolation.
