## The 14-day quarantine begins after the end of symptoms right? In the sense that they go into isolation from the beginning, but the 14-day countdown after the end?

14 days from the day you return to Canada. The 14-day quarantine is to see if you develop symptoms after exposure. If you test positive, it’s up to the treatment team to decide when you can break isolation. WHO recently published an update regarding this matter: you need to self-isolate for 14 days after the end of the symptoms to avoid community transmission (save for later, no guidelines so far).
