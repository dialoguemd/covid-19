## The 14-day quarantine begins after the end of symptoms right? In the sense that they go into isolation from the beginning, but the 14-day countdown after the end?

14 days from the day you return to Canada. The 14-day quarantine is to see if you develop symptoms after exposure. If you test positive, itâ€™s up to the treatment team to decide when you can break isolation. WHO recently published an update regarding this matter: you need to self-isolate for 14 days after the end of the symptoms to avoid community transmission (save for later, no guidelines so far).
