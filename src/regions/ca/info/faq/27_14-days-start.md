## I’ve just come back from vacation. When does the 14 day quarantine for travelers begin? If I develop symptoms and need to self-isolate, is it an additional 14 days?

The 14 days period of quarantine starts from the day you return to Canada. The 14-days quarantine is to see if you develop symptoms after exposure and to limit exposure with others in the meantime. If you test positive, it’s up to the treatment team to decide when you can break isolation.

- It is possible that people infected with COVID-19 may be infectious before showing significant symptoms. However, based on currently available data, the people who have symptoms are causing the majority of virus spread.

- For mild cases that do not require hospitalization, it is assumed that they are no longer communicable 10 days after onset of illness, as long as they have no fever at that time and have improved clinically. Absence of cough is not required for those known to have chronic cough or who are experiencing reactive airways post-infection. Some will cough for many weeks after infection (this can be normal).

- Two consecutive negative laboratory test results, at least 24 hours apart, can be used to determine the end of the communicable period.
