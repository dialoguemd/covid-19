## Can you provide me with an attestation for daycare to prove that my child does not need a test?

No, we cannot provide this as the only way is to get a proper test which requires having symptoms and calling 811.

If you have been advised to isolate yourself, you should do so in order to limit the spread of the virus in daycares.
