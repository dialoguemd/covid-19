## How long does COVID-19 remain airborne?

The World Health Organization states that droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks quickly fall on floors or surfaces. However, a Finnish study indicates that particles carrying COVID-19 may remain in suspension in the air for a few minutes.

Therefore the exact distances and duration of time for which the virus remains viable in the air is unclear. There are many factors which affect this, such as ambient airflow, humidity, whether or not we are indoors or outdoor and more. Studies are being done and we are monitoring these. The current recommendations for social distancing and masks remain in force at all times as these have been proven to be very effective.

The most important thing to know about coronavirus on surfaces is that they can easily be cleaned with common household disinfectants that will kill the virus. Studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24 hours on cardboard.
As, always clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. According to the Harvard Medical School, Coronavirus centre, infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air. Aerosols are emitted by a person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — when they talk, breathe, cough, or sneeze. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the virus. Aerosolized coronavirus can remain in the air for up to three hours. A mask can help prevent that spread.
