## How long does COVID-19 remain airborne?

The World Health Organization states that droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks quickly fall on floors or surfaces. However, a Finnish study indicates that particles carrying COVID-19 may remain in suspension in the air for a few minutes.

Therefore the exact distances and duration of time for which the virus remains viable in the air is unclear. There are many factors which affect this, such as ambient airflow, humidity, whether or not we are indoors or outdoor and more. Studies are being done and we are monitoring these. The current recommendations for social distancing and masks remain in force at all times as these have been proven to be very effective.
