## If I get sick, in how long am I expected to be better?

Symptoms develop on average from 5 to 7 days after the contamination, but may appear between 2 and 12 days. To be prudent, 14 days of isolation is recommended. The average duration is unknown and it may be extremely variable. Some have no symptoms at all, and some may require extensive prolonged treatment lasting weeks. The World Health Organization says those who become infected generally experience mild illness and recover in about two weeks.
