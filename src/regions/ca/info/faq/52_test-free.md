## Do we know if Quebec/other provinces are providing COVID-19 testing free of charge outside of having provincial plan coverage? i.e. international people temporarily here or living in canada who would need to get tested will be able to do so without having to pay out of pocket?

At this time, testing kits and COVID-19 assessment centres are managed by the government. The determination to get tested relies solely on evidence-based risk assessment and protocols, without regard to whether or not the patient is a resident/provincially-insured.
