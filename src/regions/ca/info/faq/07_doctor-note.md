## Can I get a doctor's note ?

No, we will not issue medical notes for COVID-19 unless they are the result of the Dialogue member being assessed for a medical problem that telemedicine can safely manage.
The only document for absence of COVID-19 that is valid is the documentation provided by the testing clinic stating that the patient was tested negative.
