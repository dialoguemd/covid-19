## I want to cancel my flight, what should I do?

As per Canadian government, avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice. You should contact your flight company or your travel agency. [source](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories)

Note that the waiting time to get hold of an agent can exceed 3-4 hours. If you booked before a certain date, some companies offer to file a form online instead of spending time with the hotline. Visit their website before calling.

Here is the information from main airlines in Canada:

If you subscribed to a travel cancellation insurance, or have a travel cancellation insurance with your credit card, contact them, it is likely that they will reimburse you, but confirm the proper process to follow.
Usually, you will have to cancel with the company first, then fill the cancellation form with your insurer.

If you donâ€™t have travel cancellation insurance or if you prefer this option, most companies offer a refund in credits to use before the end of the year.
