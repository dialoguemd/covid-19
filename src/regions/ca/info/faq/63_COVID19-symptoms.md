## What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

Not all patients infected with COVID-19 will show symptoms. Furthermore, it might be difficult to know if a patient has COVID-19 because some of the symptoms are similar to cold and flu.

Symptoms for COVID-19 include but are not limited to:

- Cough
- Fever
- Difficulty breathing
- Pneumonia in both lungs

In severe cases, infection can lead to death.
