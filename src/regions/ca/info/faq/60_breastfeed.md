## Can I continue breastfeeding with or without covid-19 symptoms?

Currently, the [Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/interim-guidance-cases-contacts.html) and the [World Health Organization (WHO)](http://www.emro.who.int/nutrition/nutrition-infocus/breastfeeding-advice-during-covid-19-outbreak.html) recommend that mothers with suspected or proven COVID-19 continue to breastfeed.
