## Can I continue breastfeeding with or without covid-19 symptoms?

Currently, the [Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/interim-guidance-cases-contacts.html) and the [World Health Organization (WHO)](http://www.emro.who.int/nutrition/nutrition-infocus/breastfeeding-advice-during-covid-19-outbreak.html) recommend that mothers with suspected or proven COVID-19 continue to breastfeed.

Current evidence suggests that breast milk isn’t likely to spread the virus to babies.
You, along with your family and healthcare providers, should decide whether and how to start or continue breastfeeding. Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses and is the best source of nutrition for most babies. We don’t know for sure if mothers with COVID-19 can spread the virus to babies in breast milk, but the current evidence suggests that this isn’t likely.
