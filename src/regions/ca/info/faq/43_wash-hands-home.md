 ## If I stay home, should I wash my hands on a regular basis?
 
 If you're at home, you need to wash your hands:

- After coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose or touching the inside of your mouth.
- After going to the bathroom
- Before preparing food
- With soap and water preferably for more than 20 seconds or with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if you do not have access to soap. Note that alcohol-based hand sanitizer is not effective if hands are soiled.

This allows the prevention of any type of contamination.
