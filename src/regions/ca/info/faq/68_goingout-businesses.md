## Can I go out and access businesses?

The Government of Canada states that you can go for a walk if you:

- Have not been diagnosed with COVID-19
- Do not have symptoms of COVID-19
- Have not travelled outside of Canada in the past 14 days
- Are not in quarantine (self-isolating)
- Are not isolating

If you go out for a walk, do not congregate and always practise physical (social) distancing by keeping at least 2 metres apart from others at all times.

More information here:

- [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html)
- [Canada's trusted resource for COVID-19 updates](https://www.c19.ca/)

As Canada reopens, it is important to inform yourself for rules to follow in your province or region and we ask you to comply with all posted instructions at businesses for the protection of all. Remember that although you may be very healthy and unconcerned, you can spread the virus to those who are not as fortunate.
