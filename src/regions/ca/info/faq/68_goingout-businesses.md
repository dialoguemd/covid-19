## Can I go out and access businesses?

The Government of Canada states that you can go for a walk if you:

- Have not been diagnosed with COVID-19
- Do not have symptoms of COVID-19
- Have not travelled outside of Canada in the past 14 days
- Are not in quarantine (self-isolating)
- Are not isolating

If you go out for a walk, do not congregate and always practise physical (social) distancing by keeping at least 2 metres apart from others at all times.
It should be noted that most non-essential businesses are now closed to the public. However, they still engage in e-commerce whenever it is permitted. Essential businesses such as hospitals and pharmacies are still open as well as grocery stores.
