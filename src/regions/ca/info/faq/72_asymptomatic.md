## What is the proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients?

According to WHO, For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infections, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection. Other researches state that anywhere from 25 percent to 80 percent of people with COVID-19 are unaware they have the virus. This has been confirmed by antibody testing. However, further antibody studies being done at large scale would be needed to clarify this for each area of the country.
