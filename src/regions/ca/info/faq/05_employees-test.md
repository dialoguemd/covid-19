## Where can patients get tested if they have symptoms?

Dialogue will perform a thorough medical assessment to any patient presenting symptoms to identify potential risk factors known to be linked to COVID-19 (as specified by Federal and Provincial screening protocols).

Suspected cases will be directed to the appropriate health authority. Our care team is equipped to provide information to our patients in case of a suspected infection. The informational kit includes number to call, appropriate testing sites, preventative measures to avoid spreading the potential virus).

Provincial health authorities have specific care paths patients need to follow as they centralize all cases in specific testing and treating locations. We are monitoring all Canadian and provincial screening protocols which we must follow to the letter to ensure everyoneâ€™s safety. These are changing daily or more often so we are checking the procedures in realtime and referring according to recommendations.
