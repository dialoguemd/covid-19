##Is it safe to receive a package?

Yes, according to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses), the chance that the package has been contaminated by someone carrying Covid is low, as is the chance that the virus survived the journey.

However, if you wish to eliminate 100% risk, [here](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/new-coronavirus-stable-hours-surfaces?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf (edited)) are the instructions to follow:

- Do not touch cardboard boxes for 24 hours, and do not touch plastic for 72 hours.
- If your package is perishable, put it in the fridge by a single person, who carries it away from the body and places it on a shelf alone, then wash your hands thoroughly and wait 24 to 72 hours depending on the packaging surface.
