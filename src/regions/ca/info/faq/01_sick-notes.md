## What is Dialogue's position on sick notes?

As expected, the COVID-19 pandemic is creating an unprecedented surge of demand for our clinical services. Frustratingly, a significant part of this demand relates to requests for medical notes to document absence, self isolation or fitness to return to work.

While patients have understandable economic need for this documentation, that need is driven by their employer policies, not illness. And at a time where we are going to be increasingly scarce and in short supply, we simply cannot devote time to administrative tasks that are required for clinical care.

As a result, the message below will be sent to all Dialogue clients by tomorrow morning. Note that because Dialogue eligibility is usually offered to a household, we will encounter adults whose employers are not among Dialogue clients. Regardless, the policy remains the same.

Also note that it is Dialogue's long-standing policy that we only provide medical notes that form part of the plan of treatment for a medical problem that we have assessed. We have never supported clinicians providing medical notes for patients' medical problems that are managed by a primary care provider or specialist.

We request your strict adherence to both our long-standing policy and the specific COVID-19-related points outlined below to assure that our patient population is not receiving mixed messages from our provider team.
