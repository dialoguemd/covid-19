## What is Dialogue's position on medical notes related to COVID-19?

As expected, the COVID-19 pandemic is creating an unprecedented surge of demand for our clinical services and a significant part of this demand relates to requests for medical notes to document absence, self isolation or fitness to return to work.

While patients have understandable economic need for this documentation, that need is driven by their employer policies, not illness. And at a time where we are going to be increasingly scarce and in short supply, we simply cannot devote time to administrative tasks that are required for clinical care.

Also note that it is Dialogue's long-standing policy that we only provide medical notes that form part of the plan of treatment for a medical problem that we have assessed. We have never supported clinicians providing medical notes for patients' medical problems that are managed by a primary care provider or specialist.

We do not provide any attestation related to COVID-19 risk or symptoms, based on CMA guidelines and virtual practice limitations. A communiqu√© has been sent to the companies that offer our services. The CMA (Canadian Medical Association) has asked employers to suspend requirements for notes.

This includes but is not limited to: leave of absence, preventive withdrawal from workplace, certificate of good health, proof of negative result, day care attestation.
