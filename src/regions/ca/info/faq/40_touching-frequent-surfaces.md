## When and how often should I wash/disinfect my hands and surfaces?

A [thorough hand wash](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/reduce-spread-covid-19-wash-your-hands.html) (lasting more than 20 seconds and up to 2 minutes), including fingernails, sides, palms, between fingers, tops of hands and wrists, will kill viruses that may be on your hands. Between the likelihood of the virus being on the elevator button and the effectiveness of a good hand wash, the risk is low.

It's never too late to wash your hands and remove viruses and bacteria. The longer you wait to wash your hands and the more surfaces or parts of your face you reach in that time, the more likely you are to contaminate others or yourself.

If you're at home, you need to wash your hands:

- After coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose or touching the inside of your mouth.
- After going to the bathroom
- Before preparing food
- With soap and water preferably for more than 20 seconds or with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if you do not have access to soap. Note that alcohol-based hand sanitizer is not effective if hands are soiled.

This allows the prevention of any type of contamination.

We also recommend that you make sure that these surfaces (door handles, elevator buttons, doorbell...) [are disinfected](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/cleaning-disinfecting-public-spaces.html) at least daily, and that you touch them with your elbow or with a cloth.
