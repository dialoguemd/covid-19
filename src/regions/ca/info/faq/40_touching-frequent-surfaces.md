## If I touch the highly touched surfaces of my building and wash my hands afterwards, have I really eliminated the risk of transmission?

A [thorough hand wash](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/reduce-spread-covid-19-wash-your-hands.html) (lasting more than 20 seconds and up to 2 minutes), including fingernails, sides, palms, between fingers, tops of hands and wrists, will kill viruses that may be on your hands. Between the likelihood of the virus being on the elevator button and the effectiveness of a good hand wash, the risk is low.

We also recommend that you make sure that these surfaces (door handles, elevator buttons, doorbell...) [are disinfected](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/cleaning-disinfecting-public-spaces.html) at least daily, and that you touch them with your elbow or with a cloth.
