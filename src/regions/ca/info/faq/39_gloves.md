## Do I have to wear latex or vinyl gloves when I go to the supermarket?

You do not have to wear latex or vinyl gloves when you go to the supermarket. However, hand washing before and after entering the store should be done in order to prevent infection.

Here are situations when gloves are proved to be effective:

1. If you need to be within 2 metres of the ill person, wear personal protective equipment:

- A medical mask
- Disposable gloves
- Eye protection

2. Wear disposable gloves when touching the ill person, their environment and soiled items or surfaces.
3. Clean your hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after contact with the ill person and after removing gloves, face masks and eye protection.
   Avoid reusing medical masks or gloves.

Please note that hand washing (20 seconds minimum with soap), mask use and social distancing are the best methods to protect yourself from infections.
