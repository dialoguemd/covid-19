## Do I have to wear latex or vinyl gloves when I go to the supermarket?

- If possible, people who are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 should not care for someone with COVID-19.

  - These people include elderly persons, those with chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) or compromised immune systems.

- If you need to be within 2 metres of the ill person, wear personal protective equipment:

  - A medical [mask](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#wm)
  - Disposable gloves
  - [Eye protection](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/interim-guidance-cases-contacts.html)

- Wear disposable gloves when touching the ill person, their environment and soiled items or surfaces.

- Avoid re-using medical masks or gloves.

- Clean your hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after contact with the ill person and after removing gloves, face masks and eye protection.

- Dry your hands with disposable paper towels.

  - If not available, use a reusable towel and replace it when it becomes wet.

- You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based [hand sanitizer](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/hand-sanitizer.html) containing at least 60% alcohol.

- Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
