## Do I have to wear latex or vinyl gloves when I go to a store?

People who are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 should not care for someone with COVID-19. These people include elderly persons, those with chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) or compromised immune systems.

When to wear latex or vinyl gloves during a pandemic?

1. If you need to be within 2 metres of the ill person, wear personal protective equipment:

- A medical [mask](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#wm)
- Disposable gloves
- [Eye protection](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/interim-guidance-cases-contacts.html)

2. If you need to take care of an ill person or their environment.

Other advices:

- Avoid re-using medical masks or gloves.
- Clean your hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after contact with the ill person and after removing gloves, face masks and eye protection.
- Dry your hands with disposable paper towels.
  - If not available, use a reusable towel and replace it when it becomes wet.
- You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based [hand sanitizer](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/hand-sanitizer.html) containing at least 60% alcohol.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Please note that hand washing (20 seconds minimum with soap), mask use and social distancing are the best methods to protect yourself from contamination in public and closed spaces.
