## Should I disinfect my whole house?

No, but you must clean high touched surfaces (door handles, washbasins, toilets, telephones, keys, switches, keyboards, remotes, toys, electronic devices...) daily with a suitable product (70% alcohol, diluted bleach, household disinfectant).
If the surface is dirty, first clean it with soap and water before disinfecting it.
It is important to do this even if no one is sick and you are staying at home, to avoid any type of contamination.
