## Should I be worried?

No, you’re in good hands, we’ll make sure we support you as best as we can and help you find the latest information. Governments around the world are taking what seems like big steps, but it’s simply done to "flatten the curve". This means we want to avoid the spread to vulnerable people in order to ensure that we don’t exceed the healthcare system capacity to take care of them if they get sick. Be careful with what you hear on the news and see in the social media, always research for up to date governmental information. We can help you find this information with Chloé.
