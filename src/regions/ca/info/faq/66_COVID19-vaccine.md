## How long will it take to develop a vaccine?

Vaccine development is a long, complex process, often lasting 10-15 years and involving a combination of public and private involvement. The current system for developing, testing, and regulating vaccines developed during the 20th century as the groups involved standardized their procedures and regulations.

However, given the current situation, some scientists expect a vaccine to be ready in months time (some experts mention 12 to 18 months). The Canadian government finances a large number of projects for this purpose.
