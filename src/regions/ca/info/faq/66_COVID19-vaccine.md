## Context of the new COVID-19 vaccine 

Vaccine development is a long, complex process, often lasting 10-15 years and involving a combination of public and private involvement. The current system for developing, testing, and regulating vaccines developed during the 20th century as the groups involved standardized their procedures and regulations.

On December 9, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine) (DIN 02509210) was authorized in accordance with the Interim Order Respecting the Importation, Sale and Advertising of Drugs for Use in Relation to COVID-19. Two other pharmaceuticals released antivirals for systemic use and immune serums, both approved by Health Canada. Meanwhile, 150 other potential COVID-19 vaccines are under development around the world. 

Pfizer, the Public Health Agency of Canada with the Canadian Armed Forces, and the Provinces and Territories are working together to finalize preparations, including training on how to handle the product, which must be transported and stored at -70 degrees Celsius. Important logistical tests are planned and the Government of Canada expects to conduct other rehearsals to confirm ordering and shipping processes for additional vaccines as they become available.

Health Canada’s independent drug authorization process is recognized around the world for its high standards and rigorous review. Decisions are based only on scientific and medical evidence showing that vaccines are safe and effective. The benefits must also outweigh any risks.

Canada will receive up to 249,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020. It is currently the only vaccine authorized by Health Canada. In total, Canada ordered 76 million doses to be received if the security standards continue to satisfy Health Canada’s criteria.  

Because of the critical importance, Health Canada has undertaken an accelerated but rigorous review process to assess COVID-19 vaccines. No steps in safety or efficacy are being skipped. Health Canada dedicated more scientific resources to complete these reviews so that they’re done quickly but without cutting corners. A similar process was used in 2009 to review and authorize the H1N1 pandemic vaccine. Health Canada is also able to review any new evidence as it becomes available, instead of waiting until all studies are completed.

## Efficacity 

Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is indicated for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 16 years of age and older.

Two doses spaced 3 to 4 weeks apart are required.

The New England Journal of Medicine published, in collaboration with Pfizer, published on December 10th that 52% efficacy of the vaccine was observed after the first dose and 95% was reached by the second dose. The promising results were conducted on the largest sample compared to any other covid-vaccines (more than 18 000 individuals received 2 doses of the vaccine versus more than 18 000 received 2 doses of placebo).  The study will be completed in 2023 in order to rule out side effects, especially on pregnant women and immunosuppressed individuals.

## Side effects

In general, the side effects observed during the clinical trials are similar to what you might have with other vaccines. The side effects that followed vaccine administration in clinical trials were mild or moderate. They included things like pain at the site of injection, body chills, feeling tired and feeling feverish. These are common side effects of vaccines and do not pose a risk to health. As with all vaccines, there’s a chance that there will be a serious side effect, but these are rare. A serious side effect might be something like an allergic reaction.

Health Canada has conducted a rigorous scientific review of the available medical evidence to assess the safety of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. No major safety concerns have been identified in the data that we reviewed.

People with allergies to any of the ingredients of the vaccine are currently cautioned against receiving it. The vaccine’s ingredients are as follows:
- Medicinal ingredient:mRNA.
- Non-medicinal ingredients:
ALC-0315 = ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate);
ALC-0159 = 2-[(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide;
1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine;
cholesterol;
dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate;
monobasic potassium phosphate;
potassium chloride;
sodium chloride;
sucrose;
water for injection.

## Who will get the vaccine? 
The vaccine can be administered to Canadians of 16 years and older. Because there will be limited quantities at first, once a vaccine is approved for use, at-risk candidates will need to be prioritized. Healthcare providers and vulnerable patients (seniors in long term care) will be the first to receive the vaccine. 

## Where and when can I get the vaccine?
Once the first vaccination wave for the vulnerable population (seniors or canadians with comorbidities) and healthcare providers is completed, new official information will be published for the general public.

## How much will it costs? 
The vaccine will be free for all eligible canadians.

## About the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. 
mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine. Many types of vaccines use a weakened or inactivated virus or part of a virus to trigger an immune response inside our body. However, instead of using the live virus that causes COVID-19, mRNA vaccines teach our cells how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response. Once triggered, our body then makes antibodies. These antibodies help us fight the infection if the real virus does enter our body in the future. 

Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for quite some time. Work on coronaviruses and vaccination started at the time of the SARS epidemic, which affected Toronto and China in 2003, since SARS was also caused by a coronavirus. For example, they also have been studied for flu, Zika, rabies and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Researchers have also used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target certain cancer cells. Like all vaccines, people who are vaccinated gain protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick from being exposed to the virus. People also can't get COVID-19 from the vaccine itself.
