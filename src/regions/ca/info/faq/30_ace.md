## Patient would like to change their treatment (angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors) because of the following article that supposes a hypothesis that this type of medication could be a risk factor for COVID-19

The Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the Canadian Heart Failure Society strongly discourage the discontinuation of guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) involving Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEi), Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) or Angiotensin Receptor Neprilysin Inhibitors (ARNi) in hypertensive or heart failure patients as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cessation of these drugs in stable patients can lead to uncontrolled hypertension and increased hospitalizations for heart failure with an unnecessary increase in health care utilization, straining our valuable inpatient hospital resources.

According to WHO, there is low-certainty evidence that patients on long-term therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs are not at higher risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19.
