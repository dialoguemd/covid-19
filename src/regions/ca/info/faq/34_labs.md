## I need to get labs taken. Which labs are still open to non-COVID19 tests?

If you experience symptoms such as cough, fever, runny nose or if you are at risk, call the designated covid-19 line.
More and more hospitals are no longer accepting external requests, and only process tests ordered by their own departments. It is therefore possible that they will redirect you to other resources.

Some laboratories have reduced their opening hours or limited the samples taken to urgent tests only, and have cancelled some samples collections.

We therefore recommend that you call the place before you go there.
