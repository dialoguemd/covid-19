## How do I distinguish between COVID-19 and influenza?

According to the World Health Organization, the speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19. Although COVID-19 and influenza have similar symptoms, there are a few differences that distinguish the two. Influenza spreads faster than COVID-19 but the latter has a higher number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual. Additionally, the fraction of severe and critical infections is higher for COVID-19 as well as mortality. Regardless, since the symptoms between COVID-19 and influenza are similar, influenza cases are handled as COVID-19 cases until proven otherwise.

Finally, children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.
