## How do I distinguish between COVID-19 and influenza?

Although COVID-19 and influenza have similar symptoms, there are a few differences that distinguish the two. According to the World Health Organization, influenza spreads faster than COVID-19 but the latter has a higher number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual. Additionally, the fraction of severe and critical infections is higher for COVID-19 as well as mortality. Finally, those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed whereas for COVID-19, those most at risk are elderly and those with underlying chronic medical conditions. Regardless, since the symptoms between COVID-19 and influenza are similar, influenza cases are handled as COVID-19 cases until proven otherwise.
