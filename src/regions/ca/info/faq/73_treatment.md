## What can I do to treat COVID-19?

**Treating coronavirus**

Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own, but some will require hospital care.

If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.The hospitalization rate is clearly higher than that for seasonal flu so careful self monitoring is required.

**Vaccine**

If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses. There are many active and urgent vaccine trials all over the world, however we do not know when and if these will produce a vaccine.

At this time, a vaccine or therapy to treat or prevent this disease has not yet been developed. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global review of therapies that may be used to treat or prevent the disease.

Health Canada is fast tracking the importation and sale of medical devices used to diagnose, treat or prevent COVID-19 as appropriate.
