## What can I do to treat COVID-19?

At this time, there is no approved vaccine or therapy to treat COVID-19. Studies are currently being conducted. Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own. If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should consult your provincial guidelines and follow their recommendations.
