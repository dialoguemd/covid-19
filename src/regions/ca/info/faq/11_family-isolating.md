## What to do if someone in my home has COVID-19?

The government of Canada has provided [this excellent page](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/how-to-care-for-person-with-covid-19-at-home-advice-for-caregivers.html) which describes all recommended procedures, precautions, cleaning products needed and more.

If someone in your home has COVID-19, there are additional things you can do to protect yourself and others:

- **Keep the sick person away from others** – The sick person should stay in a separate room, and use a different bathroom if possible. They should also eat in their own room.

Experts also recommend that the person stay away from pets in the house until they are better.

- **Have them cover their face** – The sick person should cover their nose and mouth with a cloth mask when they are in the same room as other people. If they can't use a face cover, you can help protect yourself by covering your face when you are in the room with them.

- **Wash hands** – Wash your hands with soap and water often (see above).

- **Clean often** – Here are some specific things that can help:
  - Wear disposable gloves when you clean. It's also a good idea to wear gloves when you have to touch the sick person's laundry, dishes, utensils, or trash.
  - When you do the sick person's laundry, avoid letting dirty clothes or bedding touch your body. Wash your hands and clean the outside of the washer after putting in the laundry.
  - Regularly clean things that are touched a lot. This includes counters, bedside tables, doorknobs, computers, phones, and bathroom surfaces.
  - Clean things in your home with soap and water, but also use disinfectants on appropriate surfaces. Some cleaning products work well to kill bacteria, but not viruses, so it's important to check labels.
