## Can chloroquine be prescribed to prevent COVID-19?

WHO is currently assessing the use of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 patients within the Solidarity Trial. The hydroxychloroquine arm has been paused as a precaution while the safety data is being reviewed.

Every country, particularly those with regulatory authorities, is in a position to advise its citizens regarding the use of any drug. Although hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are already licensed products for treating other diseases, at this stage, these drugs have not been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.

WHO has cautioned physicians against recommending or administering unproven treatments to COVID-19 patients, and cautioned people against self-medicating with them.

Several trials have been stopped and are being closely monitored for dangers associated with this treatment and there is still advice that this should never be used outside of a research protocol. We are monitoring these studies and recommendations.
