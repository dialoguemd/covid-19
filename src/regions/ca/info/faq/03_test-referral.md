## Can Dialogue practitioners refer a patient for a coronavirus test? Can a referral for a test be given over your platform or does the practitioner have to physically evaluate the patient?

To comply with requests from the federal and provincial governments, any suspected cases still must go through the provincial healthcare authority. Local health authorities have specific care paths patients need to follow as they centralize all cases in specific testing and treating locations. Dialogue can assess patients, but any suspected cases will be directed to the appropriate health authority. Patients will be provided with all the relevant information they need along with safety guidelines to avoid further spread of the virus
