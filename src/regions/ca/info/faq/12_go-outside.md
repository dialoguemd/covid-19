## Can I go outside if I am quarantined?

We strongly recommend you do not leave home unless itâ€™s to seek medical care.
If you have to be in contact with others, practice physical distancing and keep at least 2 meters between yourself and the other person.
Arrange to have groceries and supplies dropped off at your door to minimize contact.
At all times, avoid being in direct contact with people at high risk of complications (like elders, sick people, etc.).

You should know that under the Quarantine Act, anybody returning from travel must self-isolate during 14 days. Failure to respect those requirements may be punishable by fines and/or imprisonment .
