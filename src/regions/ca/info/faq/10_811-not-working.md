## What to do if 811 or if my local public health authority line is not working?

You should call 811 or your public health authority line if you have symptoms OR if you were in direct contact with a confirmed COVID-19 or if you travelled outside Canada within the last 14 days AND/OR if you have been (within the last 14 days) or are in direct contact with a person with cough/fever/flu-like symptoms. Health authoritiesâ€™ guidelines are to direct any suspicious case to the appropriate public resource. The purpose is to centralize the management of cases and ensure proper orientation of patients to testing facilities or quarantine measures.

While we are aware 811 wait times may be much higher than usual it is the only way to get an appointment in the designated testing facilities. We ask you to be persistent in reaching out to 811 (they are working hard to reduce wait times). Do not go to the ER or a WIC until you speak to 811. If you Sx worsen please call 911.

In Quebec, an alternative information line has been set up for COVID-19 to triage patients:
1-877-644-4545. (https://santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public/coronavirus-covid-19/)
