## Which individuals are more at risk?

Vulnerable populations may include:

Anyone who is:

- an older adult older adults (increasing risk with each decade, especially over 60 years)
- at risk due to underlying medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer) people of any age with chronic medical conditions (for example, lung disease, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, stroke or dementia)
- at risk due to a compromised immune system from a medical condition or treatment (e.g. chemotherapy) people of any age who are immunocompromised, including those with an underlying medical condition (for example, cancer) or taking medications which lower the immune system (for example, chemotherapy)
- people living with obesity (BMI of 40 or higher)

Individuals who may be more likely to be exposed to the COVID-19 virus because:

- Their jobs or occupations require them to be in contact with large numbers of people, which increases their chances of being exposed to someone who has COVID-19
- They live in group settings where the COVID-19 virus may transmit more easily (for example, long-term care facilities, correctional facilities, shelters, or group residences)
- They face barriers that limit their ability to access or implement effective public health measures (for example, individuals with disabilities who encounter non-accessible information, services and/or facilities)

Anyone who has:

- Difficulty reading, speaking, understanding or communicating

- Ongoing specialized medical care or needs specific medical supplies
- Ongoing supervision needs or support for maintaining independence
