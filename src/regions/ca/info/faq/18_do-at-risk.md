## What should I do if I am more at elevated risk should I catch coronavirus?

If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:

- Visit your provincial/territorial and municipal health websites to keep up-to-date about COVID-19 in your community.
- Stock up on the supplies you would need if you were to have to stay home for a few weeks, such as groceries, pet food and cleaning products.
- Prepare to stay connected with others by phone or email.
- Ask family, a neighbour or friend to help with essential errands (e.g., picking up prescriptions, buying groceries).
- Identify which services are available to deliver food or medications to your home.
- Monitor yourself for symptoms
- If possible, only leave your home for medically necessary appointments.
- Stay away from people who are sick.
- Avoid contact with others, especially those who have travelled or been exposed to the virus.

If contact cannot be avoided, take the following precautions:

- keep at least 2 metres between yourself and the other people
- Wear a mask when with others
- Give a friendly wave instead of a handshake, kiss or hug
- Keep interactions brief
