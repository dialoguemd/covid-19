## What should I do if I am more at risk?

If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:

- [Stock up on supplies](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html#Have-supplies-on-hand)
- Take [everyday precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html#take-everyday-precautions) to keep space between yourself and others.
- When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact and wash your hands often.
- [Avoid crowds](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html#avoid-crowds) as much as possible.
- Avoid [cruise travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/covid-19-cruise-ship) and non-essential air travel.
- During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, [stay home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html#stay-home) as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed.
