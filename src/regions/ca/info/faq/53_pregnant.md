## What are potential impacts of covid-19 on pregnant women and adverse effects on the fetus?

Because COVID-19 is a new disease, we are still learning how it affects pregnant women. At this time, there is **no evidence** to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19 or that their developing child could be negatively affected by COVID-19.

You can protect yourself from becoming ill by taking the following precautions:

- Stay home as much as possible, except for important medical appointments
- Talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwife about the possibility of telephone or videoconference appointments
- Avoid unnecessary visitors to your home
- Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
  - Use alcohol-based [hand sanitizer](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/hand-sanitizer.html) if soap and water are not available
- Practise [physical distancing](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/social-distancing.html) by keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from others
- Avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes
- Avoid crowded places and peak-hours
- Make limited trips to the store for essentials
- Avoid travel by public transit
