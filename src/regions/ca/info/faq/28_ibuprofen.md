## I read that ibuprofen may worsen infection with COVID-19 ?

There is no North American scientific data of this, but "Anti-inflammatory drugs have an immunosuppressive effect" – ie. they inhibit the activity of the immune system - "which promotes infections. They have a 'booster' effect," Alexandre Bleibtreu, an infectious diseases doctor at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, told the French news source FranceInfo.

Paracetamol* does not act on the same pathways as the anti-inflammatory drugs and therefore does not present the same risks, added Mr Bleibtreu. "The only side effects are in the case of liver pathologies and exceeding the recommended doses."
*paracetamol is the same as acetaminophen
