## My employer would like me to get tested before returning to work as I have traveled in the last few days. What should I do?

You need to contact your Public Health Authority line for COVID-19. They will assess the risk and decide if you should get tested. Meanwhile, make sure to self-isolate for 14 days, from the day you return to Canada. The same applies for travel to areas subject to bans on regional and inter-provincial travel which are in force in many jurisdictions in Canada.
