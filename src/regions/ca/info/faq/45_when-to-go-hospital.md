## When should I go to hospital?

Look for emergency warning signs\* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately:

- Trouble breathing
- Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
- New confusion
- Inability to wake or stay awake
- Bluish lips or face
- Sudden loss of smell or taste for unknown reasons
- Presence of new discolorations in the extremities (fingers or toes)

\*This is not an exhaustive list of all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.

Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.
