## How does COVID-19 spread?

According to the Canadian government, human coronaviruses cause infections of the nose, throat and lungs. They are most commonly spread from an infected person through:

-	respiratory droplets generated when you cough or sneeze
-	close, prolonged personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands
-	touching something with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands

Current evidence suggests person-to-person spread is efficient when there is close contact.
