## How can I protect myself from COVID-19?

The Government of Canada has many recommendations that aim to protect the health of Canadians and reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Some of those recommendations are:

- Stay at home unless you have to go to work
  - Talk to your employer about working at home if possible
  - All jurisdictions have reinforced the urgency of working from home wherever possible
- Avoid all non-essential trips in your community
- Do not gather in groups
- Limit contact with people at higher risk, such as older adults and those in poor health
- Go outside to exercise but stay close to home
- If you leave your home, always keep a distance of at least 2 arms lengths (approximately 2 metres) from others and wear a mask in situations where you cannot respect 2m distancing or in public spaces
  - Household contacts (people you live with) do not need to distance from each other unless they are sick or have travelled in the last 14 days

Additionally, the government recommends to follow its [guidelines](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html) on hygiene, physical (social) distancing, cleaning, and the use of masks. Your provincial government might have some useful or specific recommendations as well and you should consult their website to obtain more information.
