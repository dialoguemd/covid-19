## Is it possible to transmit COVID-19 if you do not have any symptoms (cough, fever, or difficult breathing)?

People are thought to be more contagious when they have the most severe symptoms (when they are sickest). You can infect others even if you aren’t showing symptoms.

The virus can be spread to others from someone who’s infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who:

- haven’t yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)
- never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)

This kind of spread is known to happen among those who are in close contact or are in enclosed or crowded settings.

However, it is possible to be contagious after being exposed to COVID-19 for up to 14 days after exposure without having any symptoms, or having symptoms that can be mistaken for the flu or a common cold.

Experts are currently studying in more details the transmission of the virus. Although contamination without symptoms appears to be less potent, it is not to be neglected, and isolation is therefore essential for proven contacts, as well as social distancing for all other people.
