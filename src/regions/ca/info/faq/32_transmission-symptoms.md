## Is it possible to transmit COVID-19 if you do not have any symptoms (cough, fever, or difficult breathing)?

People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).
Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
