## Is the medical recommendation for a patient to go into quarantine something that can be done through Dialogue?

Yes. For Dialogueâ€™s clients, each case will be assessed personally by a health care professional and quarantine will be recommended if needed. For example, we will suggest it to our clients in the following cases:

- Anyone who has any of the following symptoms: fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, or headache
- Anyone, within the last 14 days, who provide care or have close contact with a symptomatic person known or suspected to have COVID-19
- Anyone who has travelled outside Canada within the last 14 days
- Any other case where an increased level of risk has been identified

However, Dialogue will not issue medical notes related to COVID, period. Quarantine and self-isolation protocols are mandated by public health guidelines. If employers require an attestation, Dialogue will refer patients to their public health authority.
