## Is the medical recommendation for a patient to go into quarantine something that can be done through Dialogue?

You must isolate yourself for 14 days if you have:

- returned from travel outside Canada
- been diagnosed with COVID-19 - symptoms of COVID-19, even if they are mild
- been in contact with a suspected, probable or confirmed case of COVID-19

Please note that some provinces require 10 days of isolation if you do not have an history of travel.

Here are symptoms of COVID-19:

- fever or signs of a fever, including chills, sweats, muscle aches, lightheadedness)
- sudden loss of sense of smell without nasal congestion, with or without loss of taste,
- major fatigue,
- significant loss of appetite,
- general muscle pain (not related to physical exertion);
- respiratory symptoms:
- cough (new or worse),
- shortness of breath, difficulty breathing,
- sore throat,
- runny or stuffy nose;
- gastrointestinal symptoms:

Dialogue will not issue medical notes related to COVID, period. Quarantine and self-isolation protocols are mandated by public health guidelines. If employers require an attestation, Dialogue will refer patients to their public health authority.
