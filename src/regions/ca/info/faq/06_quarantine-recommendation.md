## Is the medical recommendation for a patient to go into quarantine something that can be done through Dialogue?

Yes we will suggest it to a patient in the following cases:

1. If the patient has travelled outside Canada within the last 14 days **AND/OR**
2. If patient has been (within the last 14 days) or is in direct contact with a person with cough/fever/flu-like symptoms **AND/OR**
3. If the patient is presenting flu-like symptoms.

However, Dialogue will only issue a sick note for patients presenting symptoms that justify a sick note (case 3).
