## Do I need to stay home?

**Self-isolate vs. self-monitor**

There is a difference between advice to self-isolate and advice to self-monitor.

You should self-isolate if:

- you have been diagnosed with COVID-19
- local public health has identified you as a close contact of someone diagnosed with COVID-19

If you have not been diagnosed with COVID-19 or identified as a close contact of someone with COVID-19, you may be asked to self-monitor.
This means:

- monitor yourself for symptoms of respiratory illness such as fever, cough, difficulty breathing

If symptoms develop:

- stay home
- limit contact with others
- contact local public health, and follow their instructions
