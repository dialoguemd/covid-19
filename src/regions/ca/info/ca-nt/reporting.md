## Northern Territories: Who should I contact if I think I have COVID-19?

What do you do if you become sick or think you may have been exposed to COVID-19 or another disease while traveling?

If you have been travelling in the past 14 days and you are sick you should tell a health care provider. You should also tell a health care provider if you become ill after contact with someone who has travelled (particularly if that person has been ill). If you seek health care, wear a mask or ask for one when you get there.

Let your healthcare provider know:

- Your symptoms and when they started;
- Where you have been travelling or living;
- If you became sick while travelling or have become sick since returning home;
- If you have been in close contact with someone who is sick and was travelling; and
- If you have other exposures that concern you (e.g. laboratory or animal exposures)
