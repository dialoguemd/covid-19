## Northwest Territories: Self-assessment tool

This [self-assessment tool](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/nwt-covid19-self-assessment) is to help determine whether you should visit a health care provider for further COVID-19 related assessment and testing. You can complete this tool for yourself or for someone else if they are not able.

If you are experiencing severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, do not proceed with the self-assessment tool. Call 9-1-1 or your local health care center if you are in a smaller community.
